#SVD AND SKIPGRAM Negative Sampling
svd.py: Train the word embeddings using SVD method and save
the word vectors.
skip-gram.py: Train the word embeddings using Skip gram method
(with negative sampling) and save the word vectors.
– svd-classification.py: Train any RNN on the classification
task using the SVD word vectors.
– skip-gram-classification.py: Train any RNN on the classifi-
cation task using the Skip-Gram word vectors.
