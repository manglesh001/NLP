four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister	6.303000143158636
collins well yes very well	5.8418398374330405
his circumstances he assured me and i had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad	6.4710023335911275
her heart had been but slightly touched and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice had fortune permitted it	6.095783447995488

elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her	8.273704985717158
jane cried elizabeth was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day i do not know i hope there was but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult	10.031531253376603
collins she thought with equal certainty and with considerable though not equal pleasure	6.486233211038308
collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love for mrs	7.72558470642812
collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received	8.191083554539231
darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder and when at last mr	5.691068975841504
you see on what a footing we are	8.058402996029345
in another minute mr	4.913207656388175
her character will be fixed and she will at sixteen be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous	8.587377154270202
lydia was lydia still untamed unabashed wild noisy and fearless	3.2118065001301286
he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity	6.304776559350316
they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room from thence to the librarytheir father was in neither and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother when they were met by the butler who said if you are looking for my master maam he is walking towards the little copse upon this information they instantly passed through the hall once more and ran across the lawn after their father who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock	6.18961745558828
hurst and her sister allowed it to be sobut still they admired her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and one whom they should not object to know more of	7.955020329053853
your daughter elizabeth it is presumed will not long bear the name of bennet after her elder sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire splendid property noble kindred and extensive patronage	5.227577448214587
and may i ask said elizabeth but the terms i suppose must be complied with complied with	8.065710441188163
elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr	6.0410427106766
he has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of him on his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming to have any intention of speaking miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it she turned to him and said did not you think mr	7.274860867893913
she examined into their employments looked at their work and advised them to do it differently found fault with the arrangement of the furniture or detected the housemaid in negligence and if she accepted any refreshment seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs	5.586653391482306
gardiner that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her	5.970209599200983
she will make him a very proper wife mr	8.517363767235203
yours ever caroline bingley with the officers cried lydia	6.758421196531014
the foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any country outside the united states	4.577622656466209
nothing of the past was recollected with pain and lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world	7.6538954149780425
they have at least that advantage the country said darcy can in general supply but few subjects for such a study	5.564907273110185
i shall go distracted this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and elizabeth rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself soon went away	6.512450831129608
his behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as shewed an admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded elizabeth that if left wholly to himself janes happiness and his own would be speedily secured	6.485207261157822
general information about project gutenbergtm electronic works	4.798885703647152
jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means and it was but the other day that i recommended another young person who was merely accidentally mentioned to me and the family are quite delighted with her	7.387040396081636
the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr	7.3135045663324005
she answered with equal indifference and brevity and the other said no more	6.662764652346737
he was full of joy and attention	6.045525568761377
bennet as he folded up the letter	8.411875946731957
the second began	7.934730729141591
i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr	7.077119194846593
console lady catherine as well as you can	10.300921515815139
bennet and prepared for backgammon	5.045170352457327
there was novelty in the scheme and as with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters home could not be faultless a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake	7.492236704461297
i am glad it occurred to me to mention it for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone my uncle is to send a servant for us oh your uncle he keeps a manservant does he i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things	6.2871023466917455
kitty simpered and smiled and hoped her turn was coming soon	4.894406050034106
arguments are too much like disputes	6.794141606234298
whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr	6.4095772159770465
and to see dear wickham too	9.682360087663474
wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth and she was very willing to hear him though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told the history of his acquaintance with mr	9.020459905361106
bingley never stirs without him so much the better	4.9968976739004685
wickham with money well cried her mother it is all very right who should do it but her own uncle	7.504515408003352
my sole dependence was on you and i am sure nobody else will believe me if you do not	6.659771923172828
unfeeling selfish girl	5.935879019138458
bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia	5.230281170654424
in a moment they were all out of the chaise rejoicing at the sight of each other	8.811711333958014
you have liked many a stupider person dear lizzy oh	4.945125985674585
the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances	6.374478785653119
till elizabeth entered the drawingroom at netherfield and looked in vain for mr	6.331527902651324
bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday and in her postscript it was added that if mr	8.134787706627304
illustration morning dress	5.554273203716482
i dont know	6.57368911073996
that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating and do you really know all this cried mrs	7.07041535627805
bennet who could by no means wish for so speedy a return immediately said but is there not danger of lady catherines disapprobation here my good sir you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness my dear sir replied mr	4.512155712147563
bingley was good looking and gentlemanlike he had a pleasant countenance and easy unaffected manners	5.616695619445211
we have certainly done our best and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society and from our connection with rosings the frequent means of varying the humble home scene i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome	5.37970241966494
elizabeth tried to be diverted by them but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame	6.9987740700902625
i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse	5.480841229084426
she is a very headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest but i will make her know it pardon me for interrupting you madam cried mr	6.844795113425297
we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr	6.929502609306233
she shared in their attendance on mrs	5.258543381875621
i promised them so faithfully	5.335865168504177
collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton which he never failed coming to inform them of though it happened almost every day	5.98305945300811
she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken	5.684444652204552
she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting	7.128470375770201
how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter he made no answer	9.149624311948207
it is highly improper	5.5532773633399195
bennet wrote again to his brother therefore he sent his permission for them to come and it was settled that as soon as the ceremony was over they should proceed to longbourn	6.804202840550545
i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out if possible from some of the young mans intimates in the regiment whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself	6.931458060483964
about a month ago i received this letter and about a fortnight ago i answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiring early attention	6.152170275726754
darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift	8.947031924958699
there has been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way	7.652708506319157
my sisters may write to me	7.177435860209857
are quite well but youhow are you cried elizabeth	7.431036072902284
darcy by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room and then though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate she began to regret that he came	8.826061813541523
bennet began repeating her thanks to mr	4.2991478500733065
but of all the views which his garden or which the country or the kingdom could boast none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house	6.97154479355486
she is not such a simpleton	10.288542612942258
that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr	6.916852816626367
elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county she was a most active magistrate in her own parish the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr	7.863958982505582
darcy has no defect	6.871390216914472
he owns it himself without disguise no said darcy i have made no such pretension	6.247164489566378
they crossed it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of the scene it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and the valley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppicewood which bordered it	5.3268876018413875
the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the youngest should tax mr	8.728439609860793
it was a rational scheme to be sure	7.6165846196476386
how long has she been such a favourite and pray when am i to wish you joy that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask	7.662209641306854
he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton and after receiving her answer asked in an hesitating manner how long mr	5.278613862666778
bennet invited him to dine with them but with many expressions of concern he confessed himself engaged elsewhere	6.418017952158951
darcy though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own words	6.657552712878951
she longed to see mrs	7.201548197597144
my dear jane mr	5.349819663858525
my dear continued mrs	5.322246318169645
darcy looked therefore she could not tell	8.299823423759943
bennet was alone than she likewise began on the subject calling on miss lucas for her compassion and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family	6.950127608545993
when i last saw her she was not very promising	8.845461562663864
dear lizzy only consider what he must have suffered	8.417318517416364
bennet and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr	7.7672906332783835
collins meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passed	4.542660316379404
hursts gown here she was interrupted again	7.223919698541626
it was acknowledged however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor	7.116764334189302
she longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really absent but had not courage for it	6.335387479346841
by this time my dearest sister you have received my hurried letter i wish this may be more intelligible but though not confined for time my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent	6.192431898781267
she looked at his two sisters and saw them making signs of derision at each other and at darcy who continued however impenetrably grave	5.908884010563912
for though elated by his rank it did not render him supercilious on the contrary he was all attention to every body	7.104950565364472
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it	8.387541391192762
i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairs between the mercenary and the prudent motive	5.96285289442836
but why mr	6.395305691145343
yours c	6.5144592801956
the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic	6.733172415343372
when first mr	5.865105966643547
i am afraid mr	4.786294055282716
his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but his reliance on mine made every thing easy	5.2750998058712
my temper i dare not vouch for it is i believe too little yieldingcertainly too little for the convenience of the world	7.6431662978926225
well and so we breakfasted at ten as usual i thought it would never be over for by the bye you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them	6.9121610355795235
had the late mr	6.8500939384302715
the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master who was coming down in a day or two to shoot there for several weeks	7.144018130505575
i shall then give over every expectation every wish of his constancy	6.144251288277832
for i dare not hope he continued in a lower and more serious tone that he is improved in essentials oh no said elizabeth	6.733349256092984
my aunt told me so herself on saturday	6.298139119062404
darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend is he poor eliza to be only just tolerable i beg you would not put it into lizzys head to be vexed by his illtreatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him	7.924392450142479
more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than when they last met were plainly expressed	5.051863543313137
here again i shall give you painto what degree you only can tell	5.804249076466841
yesthere is nothing in that	9.956571127363382
only think of its being three months she cried since i went away it seems but a fortnight i declare and yet there have been things enough happened in the time	7.34858854677102
well how pleased i am	7.195862163209644
he now wished it more than ever	7.622753012237059
elizabeth easy and unaffected had been listened to with much more pleasure though not playing half so well and mary at the end of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs at the request of her younger sisters who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room	5.90364888578024
bingley if he had been imposed on would have much to suffer when the affair became public	8.443958603403331
after a short pause her companion added you are too generous to trifle with me	5.0566797563727635
when a woman has five grown up daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty in such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think of but my dear you must indeed go and see mr	6.627092978903199
bingley called again and alone	6.979034845958355
elizabeths collected behaviour however soon quieted his emotion and as miss bingley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to wickham georgiana also recovered in time though not enough to be able to speak any more	5.211788291500477
in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minute description which wickham could give and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor she was delighting both him and herself	5.705514030163854
when the party broke up lydia returned with mrs	4.817906272671298
bennet i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad or she could not be guilty of such an enormity at so early an age	7.0268696866511196
miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard	7.4347982674390956
is it not clear enough does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister that she is perfectly convinced of her brothers indifference and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly to put me on my guard	7.049006345750999
he has been accused of many faults at different times but this is the true one	5.522921739214733
darcys letter to lady catherine was in a different style and still different from either was what mr	6.312715700827284
when she is secure of him there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses your plan is a good one replied elizabeth where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married and if i were determined to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it	7.3937411704055505
never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting	7.262519811653495
his words seemed to imply it	5.974366483754693
believe her to be deceived by all means	8.550802799419518
if an individual project gutenbergtm electronic work is posted with the permission of the copyright holder your use and distribution must comply with both paragraphs NUM e NUM through NUM e NUM and any additional terms imposed by the copyright holder	4.395206915528414
i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him	8.08631394403968
bennet offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood	5.885830566326862
he has some friends though perhaps not so many as he deserves elizabeth who knew this to be levelled at mr	6.418634515471116
and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would believe capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them	7.129642839206371
but what said she after a pause can have been his motive what can have induced him to behave so cruelly a thorough determined dislike of mea dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy	5.665266732872064
then the two third he danced with miss king and the two fourth with maria lucas and the two fifth with jane again and the two sixth with lizzy and the boulanger if he had had any compassion for me cried her husband impatiently he would not have danced half so much	7.772428884238024
if you were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up in marrying your nephew i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere	6.609312361057549
he is perfectly amiable	7.198231822434608
the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person	7.347879724811986
annesley a genteel agreeablelooking woman whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others and between her and mrs	5.88322636205037
hurst and elizabeth herself	9.246822169549203
it was hardly enough but it pleased her	7.516341071019502
i hope my dear said mr	6.261411402927005
after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her the visitor did at last appear but the shortness of her stay and yet more the alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself no longer	6.0463161048759755
she enquired after his sister but could do no more	7.753830647127012
tis too much she added by far too much	6.927121034866622
well well and so mr	7.994390912623584
they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle driving up the street	8.624047476528213
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related	9.537171966568359
yet now i must believe you cried jane	8.138922879189161
collins sat for some time without speaking to any body	5.933469933328051
you forget that i have made no answer	8.069035479474877
collinss offer was now nearly at an end and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother	6.766903528015798
it keeps him in good humour said she and i am more obliged to you than i can express charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time	9.284436750263323
you know it is not sound and that you would never act in this way yourself occupied in observing mr	7.453166027377961
they are all for what they can get	9.326677201165666
i will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again well all i know is that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him	5.97750953844213
darcy might have done as well mr	7.58777082330735
a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter	6.478269513413701
after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with it is your turn to say something now mr	7.090752330055814
in such an exigence my uncles advice and assistance would be every thing in the world he will immediately comprehend what i must feel and i rely upon his goodness oh	7.256581580397114
mr	6.377314409826207
this he considered sufficient encouragement and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed	7.924643893395672
darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton with great energybut it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic you are severe on us it will be her turn soon to be teazed said miss lucas	6.72792836690806
on being made acquainted with the present mr	8.181720711692103
elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal	6.873312855861258
how can it affect them my dear mr	5.396065902571292
collins very gravely but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you	7.840724527520451
when coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him and she sat down directly to the instrument	8.51436377975669
are sufficiently known	6.109570475377969
collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday	6.409404995386947
in this room they were received by miss darcy who was sitting there with mrs	8.404144840416421
he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marryingand from that i am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before and till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained a doubt i suppose of their being really married how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains	6.2243579954511725
my dearest lizzy will i am sure be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment at my expence when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingleys regard for me	6.299141470933612
bennet should only hear of the departure of the family without being alarmed on the score of the gentlemans conduct but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together	6.564411505741154
miss darcy and her brother appeared and this formidable introduction took place	7.038479875296749
elizabeth soon observed and instantly understood it	4.945021230994198
every body is disgusted with his pride	7.670858677295774
all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes	8.027787196975048
you shall not for the sake of one individual change the meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me that selfishness is prudence and insensibility of danger security for happiness i must think your language too strong in speaking of both replied jane and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together	5.603090089856393
i am by no means of opinion i assure you said he that a ball of this kind given by a young man of character to respectable people can have any evil tendency and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especially a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause and not to any disrespect for her elizabeth felt herself completely taken in	7.356527269567333
i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me wrong	5.007702667146594
it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and niece that such a striking civility as miss darcys in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to a late breakfast ought to be imitated though it could not be equalled by some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning	7.689799619463939
he had by that time reached it also and holding out a letter which she instinctively took said with a look of haughty composure i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you	6.707642046051042
he is as fine a fellow said mr	4.69775268256638
the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected	6.60169418633527
i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble my dear sister said he as he joined her	5.465975124618475
were it for nothing but his love of you i must always have esteemed him but now as bingleys friend and your husband there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me	8.139110194114618

this was exactly as it should be for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming	8.98980733612989
collins having been in waiting near the lodges to make them his parting obeisance was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very good health and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings	5.359503930551864
she looks sickly and cross yes she will do for him very well	7.011218862950878
your father of course may spare you if your mother can daughters are never of so much consequence to a father	7.092616677861312
miss darcy on her brothers entrance exerted herself much more to talk and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted and forwarded as much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side	7.44267362766929
her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking which ceased when he saw her no more but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time she had the same story to repeat every day	8.080644296916466
we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton	7.2235206276479245
she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did	6.951972970872413
bingleys invitation and if he did whether he would think it proper to join in the evenings amusement and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop or lady catherine de bourgh by venturing to dance	6.501749148463374
bennet elizabeth and one of the younger girls together soon after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise mrs	7.774326476862974
jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london and when she wrote again elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys	9.022723204605843
seriously however she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentlemans concurrence	8.072156911322152
and with no one to speak to of what i felt no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had	9.039395834808596
as they went down stairs together charlotte said i shall depend on hearing from you very often eliza that you certainly shall and i have another favour to ask	7.483617756628689
my situation in life my connections with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you	6.703248483177777
it settled the matter and they pursued the accustomed circuit which brought them again after some time in a descent among hanging woods to the edge of the water in one of its narrowest parts	5.917404181780835
bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer she could spare them very well against staying longer however elizabeth was positively resolvednor did she much expect it would be asked and fearful on the contrary as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long she urged jane to borrow mr	4.860935847512815
her brother whose eye she feared to meet scarcely recollected her interest in the affair and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully	7.3038324807450525
bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match	5.469323822008402

and she was only sixteen last june	7.098718709343786
his belief of her sisters insensibility she instantly resolved to be false and his account of the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice	9.189327221924597
the wisest and the best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke certainly replied elizabeth there are such people but i hope i am not one of them	7.2436217639435325
we seem to have been designed for each other elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts	7.10315888796055
very little was said by either kitty was too much afraid of him to talk elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution and perhaps he might be doing the same	7.394200051701808
long and her nieces must stand their chance and therefore as she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i will take it on myself the girls stared at their father	7.472733289777779
lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball and a report soon followed that mr	6.791386427736952

elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sisters room and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from mr	9.56234683495372
darcy who was leaning against the mantlepiece with his eyes fixed on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise	5.908960724115059
soon after you left me on saturday i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were	8.188870207602477

and since this sad affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt but i hope this may be false oh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him this could not have happened perhaps it would have been better replied her sister	6.385381398493029
people did say you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas but however i hope it is not true	6.700697379035425
but it ended in nothing and i will not be sent on a fools errand again his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen on his returning to netherfield	6.964453523269626
he absolutely started and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the party and spoke to elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least of perfect civility	5.850509571322781
miss bingley i am sure cannot	7.948132266656478
she could think of nothing but of mr	7.221376007918
he had some intention he added of studying the law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein	6.814967247060129
excuse mefor i must speak plainly	6.44304420106901
her niece was therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction but their progress was slow for mr	6.452219551973501
she was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more it now first struck her that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings in the absence of more eligible visitors	6.31163439246131

collins had only to change from jane to elizabethand it was soon donedone while mrs	6.273773067074962
bennet regretted that their stay would be so short and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter and having very frequent parties at home	8.251468751153526
but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together	6.501899823651548

her colour changed and she said no more	8.110690153147972
bennet was perfectly satisfied and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements new carriages and wedding clothes she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four months	5.593874279651062
they are gone off together from brighton	5.401535169101055

in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mothers words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr	6.542097555700767
she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved while they were dressing he came two or three times to their different doors to recommend their being quick as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner such formidable accounts of her ladyship and her manner of living quite frightened maria lucas who had been little used to company and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at st	6.604665007549015

i am perfectly serious in my refusal you could not make me happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation were it certain that lady catherine would think so said mr	7.8925113624495875

he drew a chair near her	5.6480334658279086

gardiner thought of him and mrs	7.9713035993981896
this must be the grossest falsehood and when she had gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not regard it that she would never look in it again	7.68933729642121
she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known she was aware that no one liked him but jane and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away	9.329729188692198
kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do	6.653964676454584

you will only think i feel more than i ought to do when i tell you all what do you mean why i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley	9.77452246110926
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydias leaving home	6.789663378588868
this is not quite enough to make her understand his character not as you represent it	7.2831274058257875
it adds even another motive	4.706065816298172
this however was no evil to elizabeth and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors	7.307730355371811
she saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at present unknown	7.264245107916416

you deserve no such attention	6.772412294205972
collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him	5.669083197658918
if it were merely a fine house richly furnished said she i should not care about it myself but the grounds are delightful	6.093784529400585
but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill lydia declared herself satisfied	8.203785596027085
not that i mean to find fault with you for such things i know are all chance in this world	9.44508937365974
miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of hertfordshire her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances and urged the possibility of mistakesbut by everybody else mr	4.639817666463847
with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give which a just sense of shame would not conceal	7.89027368574355
gardiner abused her stupidity	4.689237201559701
but though every thing seemed neat and comfortable she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion	5.958615323240816
it was too early in the morning for visitors and besides the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours	7.8553491627133445
their taking her home and affording her their personal protection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge	4.7288057623670285
there are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoyment of music than myself or a better natural taste	5.469135839054312
the rector of a parish has much to do in the first place he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron	7.931428440989887
i know we dine with four and twenty families nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance	5.91590791857826
as long as she stays there it is all very well	7.79311240219555
bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs	4.996894151728564
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley another intreaty that she would be serious however produced the desired effect and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment	5.372151996446059
caroline did not return my visit till yesterday and not a note not a line did i receive in the mean time	6.722252631085665
it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation console herself for the present and prepare for another disappointment	6.104443262894491
she blushed at the very idea and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk	8.379521074533196
collins in time the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret	7.320866530018711
come here child cried her father as she appeared	9.084849388093355
she was not equal however to much conversation and when miss bingley left them together could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with	6.890559754328903
this she would not hear of but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brothers proposal and it was settled that mr	8.615716196737177
they will join me early tomorrow he continued and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you mr	4.201609480392625
darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections	7.115700891562926
but when they see as i trust they will that their brother is happy with me they will learn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again though we can never be what we once were to each other that is the most unforgiving speech said elizabeth that i ever heard you utter	7.8847444176191495
allowing for the common demands of the game mr	8.574494594828275
i think i have heard you say that you know them i know them a little	10.995867616302325
i have nothing either to hope or fear and nothing to reproach him with	6.528488674567074
they had not been long together before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her and she had barely time to express her satisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when bingleys quick step was heard on the stairs and in a moment he entered the room	7.176961020218507
it has been my own doing and i ought to feel it you must not be too severe upon yourself replied elizabeth	9.01304664460237
but if i were you i would stand by the nephew	8.632790350145285
rendered spiritless by the illsuccess of all their endeavours he had yielded to his brotherinlaws intreaty that he would return to his family and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit	7.919944472145702
darcy she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought and to prevent its ever happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd yet it did and even a third	5.996752217288463
wickhams chief object was unquestionably my sisters fortune which is thirty thousand pounds but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement	6.296023319297299
it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again	8.79732994439202
she is a great deal too ill to be moved	7.5994100209881505
but before they heard again from mr	5.001615244197068
my dear aunt how could you think of it	7.174816504007511
anxious and uneasy the period which passed in the drawingroom before the gentlemen came was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil	5.501139239845151
i came to try you	8.06192100353815
he was writing and without raising his head coolly replied just as you please may we take my uncles letter to read to her take whatever you like and get away elizabeth took the letter from his writing table and they went up stairs together	6.105335935375759
let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers chapter v	4.061768109752337
why is not every body as happy elizabeths congratulations were given with a sincerity a warmth a delight which words could but poorly express	4.862539407707852
the suspicions which had just arisen of mr	5.923922564723905
bennet still up	6.258054754904933
the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable but elizabeth less clearsighted perhaps in his case than in charlottes did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence	6.848564405105557
your idea of the ponies is delightful	8.198242621769605
but above all above respect and esteem there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked	6.32628566746035
i should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me chapter xviii	6.458211577926439
are you not diverted oh	7.006892469427786

when i went away i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again	7.97742626719004
darcy was writing and miss bingley seated near him was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister	5.282082168662072
at last it arrested herand she beheld a striking resemblance of mr	3.3978904908614536
collins cried elizabeth with some warmth you puzzle me exceedingly	5.497481703636072
it is of no consequence	6.794704897941471
she had been watching him the last hour she said as he walked up and down the street and had mr	7.261342746880571
and his sisters are charming women	6.552291200616808
bennet before breakfast a conversation beginning with his parsonagehouse and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn produced from her amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement a caution against the very jane he had fixed on as to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to sayshe could not positively answerbut she did not know of any prepossessionher eldest daughter she must just mentionshe felt it incumbent on her to hint was likely to be very soon engaged mr	6.7378635540523195
but her conclusion was false for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton these visitors came	5.408472177090033
i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge	7.331464669193078
i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way i can easily believe it	7.850266653277385
convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingleys dislike of her had originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her and was curious to know with how much civility on that ladys side the acquaintance would now be renewed	7.12735481400132
that tall proud man good gracious	4.2765749871183125
at present indeed they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood it was to remain the whole winter and meryton was the head quarters	7.698801276697725
lady catherine was generally speakingstating the mistakes of the three others or relating some anecdote of herself	4.533947913311657
it has been a very agreeable day said miss bennet to elizabeth	10.145882839113712
in spite of having been at st	7.363969565205738
those that best pleased her as placing his conduct in the noblest light seemed most improbable	4.960056177486628
she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all	8.208895574765322
but her commendation though costing her some trouble could by no means satisfy mr	3.8134145279667004
it is every way horrible darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence	3.708669780004734
it was greatly my wish that he should do so he added as soon as his marriage was fixed on	7.147154170406797
so much the better	6.937831222274344
in the absence of jane he always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her and when bingley was gone jane constantly sought the same means of relief	8.614546750716828
no thanks to his gallantry for that	8.870045408620722
darcys house and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture	5.2894083675752475
bennet joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was	5.07609415923752
bingleys name was scarcely ever mentioned between them	5.5612266307833575
bennet made no answer and each of them deep in thought continued silent till they reached the house	4.615591919250027
darcy has not made him just to you if from no better motive that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest for dishonesty i must call it it is wonderful replied wickham for almost all his actions may be traced to prideand pride has often been his best friend	6.163161664373296
after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss bingleys voice elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family	5.981074452457817
but as no such delicacy restrained her mother an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley express her impatience for his arrival or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back she should think herself very ill used	6.866325684509952
collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane in order to have the earliest assurance of it and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park hurried home with the great intelligence	6.667590004567669
i remember as soon as ever i saw him when he first came into hertfordshire last year i thought how likely it was that you should come together	7.75161197419558
but however insincere you may choose to be you shall not find me so	8.145820481081158
elizabeth looked expressively at lydia but she who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible gaily continued oh	6.259806168914454
forster the wife of the colonel of the regiment to accompany her to brighton	8.942385168775079
if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of temper she could not contribute much to my felicity sir you quite misunderstand me said mrs	5.215260099240103
gardiner added in his letter that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day which was saturday	9.333973724252495
i shall never forget her appearance this morning	5.041126847091209
but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient when required to depend on his affection for her for a woman who had already refused him as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham	5.991104749804904
she dreaded seeing wickham again and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible	7.689665403803187
wickham he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them and a ball was at any rate a ball	7.978244884322042
to be sure that did seem as if he admired herindeed i rather believe he didi heard something about itbut i hardly know whatsomething about mr	4.16921076083688
collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction	7.515887321898956
how could he spare half ten thousand pounds if we are ever able to learn what wickhams debts have been said elizabeth and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall exactly know what mr	6.0954694887859935
bingley must be down again in the summer	10.492071354824326
in his present behaviour to herself moreover she had a fresh source of displeasure for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve after what had since passed to provoke her	5.887031329650689
elizabeth was now to see mr	8.100716981472678

why could not he keep on quarrelling with you as his father did before him why indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head as you will hear hunsford near westerham kent 15th october dear sir the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness and since i have had the misfortune to lose him i have frequently wished to heal the breach but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance there mrs	5.67200427594058
bennet who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday which would exactly finish janes week could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before	6.649009537401792
the first wish of my heart said she to herself is never more to be in company with either of them	9.486309765906757
i never was	7.146094088659449
i should be sorry you know to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire oh	6.678515250812782
his principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham	6.311495864950368
the ladies had crowded round the table where miss bennet was making tea and elizabeth pouring out the coffee in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair	5.919139794205029
bingley intended it likewise and sometimes made choice of his county but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield and leave the next generation to purchase	7.63215078504327
stop me whilst you can you persist then in supposing his sisters influence him yes in conjunction with his friend i cannot believe it	5.7985965818154055
they followed her into the diningparlour	7.869532827796628
elizabeth now began to revive	7.267008496171709

robert william chapman this ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever	3.6309413987658727
i need not explain myself farther and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless yet if she feels it it will easily account for her behaviour to me and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable	7.5046492545604915
he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names	3.7414448755872414
as for mary she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection soon after they were seated at table this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of	7.560431465676215
it mortifies me	5.611747107464196
he was not seated by her perhaps that was the reason of his silence but it had not been so in derbyshire	10.613349181943779

i did not expect such a compliment did not you	9.778328208188935
after playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air and soon afterwards mr	4.760203502027474
i thought him very slyhe hardly ever mentioned your name	4.914166160013085
gardiner had formed of their being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing	6.474650242225462
lydias being settled in the north just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire was a severe disappointment and besides it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body and had so many favourites	8.674361731028924
elizabeth silently attended her	6.310908368783023
bennet with great civility begged her ladyship to take some refreshment but lady catherine very resolutely and not very politely declined eating any thing and then rising up said to elizabeth miss bennet there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn	6.717202658953823
in a doleful voice mrs	5.367876843576349
you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane	7.284399036347608
i have met with two instances lately one i will not mention the other is charlottes marriage	6.032618926527916
when first he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all were	7.350457125543678
in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived	7.693873212291516
she practises very constantly so much the better	4.831472487687484
i do not remember her name among the ladies at court her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town and by that means as i told lady catherine myself one day has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament	4.933103489269331
not like the wild young men nowadays who think of nothing but themselves	5.481993390459191
hurst soon found even his open petition rejected	3.9063697820241345
bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the rest and talked only to each other	6.913875041549205
do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent	6.7611683162989085
but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonishand perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else here you are in your own family upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood except netherfield	7.18522053889795
as the day of his arrival drew near i begin to be sorry that he comes at all said jane to her sister	10.82633854237998
this is the estimation in which you hold me	7.182927813241384
he enquired in a friendly though general way after her family and looked and spoke with the same goodhumoured ease that he had ever done	7.152401964536291
collinss fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two but that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum and she could not help crying out engaged to mr	6.440078500822949
such a charming man so handsome	7.390079341293041
let me know every thing that i am to know without delay	8.089114842180257
from what we have seen of him continued mrs	8.051979039133473
i have not the pleasure of understanding you said he when she had finished her speech	6.608301059608911
besides there was truth in his looks it is difficult indeedit is distressing one does not know what to think i beg your pardonone knows exactly what to think but jane could think with certainty on only one point that mr	5.9650743660425505
collinss pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much	4.405414865399294
bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet it came from netherfield and the servant waited for an answer	7.2703167884040525
every object in the next days journey was new and interesting to elizabeth and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight	8.174717392535374
darcy and herself	6.692105319999651
collins attending them to point out its beauties and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer	6.5955004635929795
he was exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us if i had not perceived by janes letter last wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain	8.546977065353204
all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over	7.965044020597127
fixed there by the keenest of all anguish self reproach she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness	5.443809250934535
the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brothers in sending it	5.169435897763492
let the other young ladies have time to exhibit mary though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerted and elizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her fathers speech was afraid her anxiety had done no good others of the party were now applied to	7.179341787272213
send back your answer as soon as you can and be careful to write explicitly	5.806183600692672
and you saw the old housekeeper i suppose	7.767988386600351
bennet at conversation and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr	5.878046933892904
i quite forgot	5.880445973529769
your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications	5.375780625833212
but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in lydias marriage	7.616807896479899
in future i hope we shall be always of one mind she held out her hand he kissed it with affectionate gallantry though he hardly knew how to look and they entered the house	6.334074007398905
two obstacles of the five being thus removed mrs	5.884567070585257
i always had a value for him	7.285260160294345
came on into hertfordshire anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes and at the inns in barnet and hatfield but without any success no such people had been seen to pass through	5.749328395663656
i will go directly to mr	5.245847976184825
i am dear sir c	5.969756606384655

you and papa and my sisters must come down and see us	6.972909519644156
if he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare he determined to make enquiries there and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach	5.670624632218144
the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week and allowing for the loss of sir william and there being only one card table in the evening every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first	6.141433900755804
give my love to colonel forster i hope you will drink to our good journey	6.558978060252017
i am perfectly satisfied	5.676010630338528
he looked surprised displeased alarmed but with a moments recollection and a returning smile replied that he had formerly seen him often and after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man asked her how she had liked him	7.50541693659427
charlotte says she hardly ever does	6.093307020333725
what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes did not err	7.887802401568039
no my dear you had better go on horseback because it seems likely to rain and then you must stay all night that would be a good scheme said elizabeth if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home oh	7.973488737908472
thus we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition	4.93392799531852
we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us said mrs	4.968175148952773
and is such a girl to be my nephews sister	9.92139198534046
bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister that they did not once sit down to a family dinner	8.166766571246415
now be sincere did you admire me for my impertinence for the liveliness of your mind i did you may as well call it impertinence at once	8.015015343070777
she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect	7.494054726624215
could she have seen half as much love in mr	7.713967143664743
i fancy lizzy that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all	7.128129427350611
i know it all that the young mans marrying her was a patchedup business at the expence of your father and uncles	9.192560376468348
as for jane her anxiety under this suspence was of course more painful than elizabeths but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing and between herself and elizabeth therefore the subject was never alluded to	5.824564959311818
she is all affability and condescension and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over	7.290771948087229
collins was wishing to marry you	6.459488865221814
the day passed much as the day before had done	9.530676092562485
the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield	6.52110942128742
you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing	8.543212427662978

philips was very thankful for his compliance but could not wait for his reason	8.768233690678755
kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressingroom elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother but remained quietly in the hall till she and kitty were out of sight then returned into the drawingroom	6.950121522686882
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself	6.7805800734298645
you could scarcely escape discredit and misery	5.063781838025387
can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it not perhaps of neglecting his own interest	6.970655011897319
do not let us quarrel about the past	7.830044385785333
if it was not for the entail i should not mind it what should not you mind i should not mind any thing at all let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility i never can be thankful mr	8.535468424018505
it was spoken of again while they were at dinner when mr	5.3375570684209075
collins and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings	6.838744925697693
had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you	5.697731629703481
no officer is ever to enter my house again nor even to pass through the village	4.683643649333773
bennet instantly answered oh dear yescertainly i am sure lizzy will be very happyi am sure she can have no objection come kitty i want you up stairs and gathering her work together she was hastening away when elizabeth called out dear maam do not go i beg you will not go mr	5.417315603214078
a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it	4.607112073484953
his accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all the compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother	7.757716661577225
he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins from a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail to conjecture his design and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise for though feeling almost secure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday	6.4329014718159625
collins who was complimenting mr	5.418212587935395
international donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the united states	3.6761495772240806
absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again and weakened her disgust of mr	4.635820007229064
but who could have foreseen such an attention as this	6.779824246953021
we will settle with your father about the money afterwards but the things should be ordered immediately she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico muslin and cambric and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders had not jane though with some difficulty persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted	6.132242153934517
but there are two things that i want very much to knowone is how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about and the other how i am ever to pay him money	7.418259626361181
what could he mean	8.396976859054607
collins was a very genteel pretty kind of girl	6.612931634823309
elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyships carriage was ready to take them all home	8.548182955130956
darcy who though extremely surprised was not unwilling to receive it when she instantly drew back and said with some discomposure to sir william indeed sir i have not the least intention of dancing i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner mr	6.858207133145074
darcy however should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable	6.602661709046544
darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street but he would hardly think a months ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities were he once to enter it and depend upon it mr	5.34185966858581
well my comfort is i am sure jane will die of a broken heart and then he will be sorry for what he has done but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she made no answer	7.49508629269244
he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying made no mention of the business that had taken him away and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it	9.297171630127231
i do indeed replied elizabeth colouring	6.551520196732187
i had no notion but he would go a shooting or something or other and not disturb us with his company	6.455033000136935
with assumed tranquillity he then replied i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that i rejoice in my success	8.370536648702478
and having to relate such a thing of his sister	9.456819440969515
his consenting to marry her is a proof i will believe that he is come to a right way of thinking	8.886849638576642
darcy said nothing at all	6.692660594380081
collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they had	7.565655099113805
collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed which certainly was not unseldom she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte	5.285794063313299
but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister or say half that remained to be said for the present	9.268094825894464
bennet treasured up the hint and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces	8.475932692243422
oh yes if one could but go to brighton	5.365180413746647
it is mr	5.46697359320207
the prospect of such delights was very cheering and they parted in mutual good spirits	5.999621307273154
the whole of what elizabeth had already heard his claims on mr	6.86902954358484
my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers	11.28880199875103
and so darcy did every thing made up the match gave the money paid the fellows debts and got him his commission	5.65439381851396
robinson perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr	6.155230530373309
i often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice	5.166480466100724
jamess never sir do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it you have a house in town i conclude mr	9.430250162902759
to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane and must at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate and her fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurried into repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister farther	7.125702661841521
they were able to love each other even as well as they intended	8.402312036708674
do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends	10.074277199370039
but your arts and allurements may in a moment of infatuation have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family	6.735343275044951
darcy the gardeners expression of surprise on beholding his master must immediately have told it	4.104166756082675
hurst also made her a slight bow and said he was very glad but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingleys salutation	5.897940513607738
he who she had been persuaded would avoid her as his greatest enemy seemed on this accidental meeting most eager to preserve the acquaintance and without any indelicate display of regard or any peculiarity of manner where their two selves only were concerned was soliciting the good opinion of her friends and bent on making her known to his sister	4.743361690481295
his pride never deserts him but with the rich he is liberalminded just sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeable allowing something for fortune and figure the whist party soon afterwards breaking up the players gathered round the other table and mr	4.641349699548495
collins will be very glad of your company i am sure i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation replied elizabeth but it is not in my power to accept it i must be in town next saturday why at that rate you will have been here only six weeks	8.63605376252356
after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity mr	4.994919468978927
by you i was properly humbled	8.80766515832986
denny comes back from town lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue but mr	4.208136823815448
jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening	6.082640896740839
i will try again	5.832279933832236
he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious to reestablish a character	6.359385006314974
her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr	6.99804790755528
do not be afraid of my running into any excess of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will	6.22645519021286
collins pointed out with a rapturous air the fine proportion and finished ornaments they followed the servants through an antichamber to the room where lady catherine her daughter and mrs	4.72249250993012
i cannot understand it	5.693409361309643
the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr	8.488513823664055
darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him without any reason	8.064288312971405
i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject but i will not leave the country without confiding them and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable	7.315461575574325
when the clock struck three elizabeth felt that she must go and very unwillingly said so	6.508490224554347
miss lucas is married and settled	6.601607453020617
his father was an excellent man said mrs	6.182231097812029
and then said she if that very improbable event should ever take place i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself	6.523401889349825
most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error and seek to clear one without involving the other	4.015002680571188
when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over he naturally returned to all his former indolence	5.165638066146175
i know not in what manner under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at	7.527598781064257
project gutenbergtm ebooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as public domain in the u s	4.831887242623372
darcy said very little and mr	6.7740273262979835
darcybut let me not interrupt you sir you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy but sir williams allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane who were dancing together	5.9289599546374205
elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears filled the eyes of both lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives	6.681048027551557
bingley from your sister and the other that i had in defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of mr	4.850257436905513
such a countenance such manners	7.448717579761007
i understand that mr	6.552215556756838
u s	6.312881935425624
regard for my sisters credit and feelings prevented any public exposure but i wrote to mr	5.4129818946542425
but at length by elizabeths persuasion he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation and after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt her resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley in spite of that pollution which its woods had received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city	7.099255777021998
darcy she could not but allow that mr	5.825264984624958
my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands you cant think	5.089560460541039
i do not know who is good enough for him mr	6.228059212338107
imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me exceed their income	4.332939187192216
her mothers thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to venture near her lest she might hear too much	5.958360826438487
her ladyship was highly incensed	6.734551317810997
janes is nothing to itnothing at all	6.76803387939429
but my dear elizabeth she added what sort of girl is miss king	6.336325893314808
i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least ah	5.170210636173184
yes there was something in that i told you so from the first you may remember i did hear too that there was a time when sermonmaking was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders and that the business had been compromised accordingly you did	8.965144717879618
it is useless to talk of it it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened	8.667024940571904
but perhaps added he stopping in his walk and turning towards her these offences might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design	5.340110975310294
she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue and the mere stateliness of money and rank she thought she could witness without trepidation	4.882170224166612
every kind of pride must revolt from the connection	7.276890576701874
gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world	8.327286359298638
one morning about a week after bingleys engagement with jane had been formed as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the diningroom their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of a carriage and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn	7.5539424017086745
but do you always write such charming long letters to her mr	5.819303640385643
not that i think charlotte so very plainbut then she is our particular friend she seems a very pleasant young woman said bingley	6.1415514329524985
you thought the waiter must not hear as if he cared	8.214819165347471
about the court such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to rosings	6.739193721340405
colonel forster came yesterday having left brighton the day before not many hours after the express	5.91696543461162
catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort	8.827357039568458
it had not been very great he had lost every point but when mrs	7.975453901048088
elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly the compliment must be all for herself	7.898712070823852
bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase an estate but did not live to do it mr	6.197468100550453
these were the contents my dear harriet you will laugh when you know where i am gone and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise tomorrow morning as soon as i am missed	8.284620864561255
instead of viewing them as a stranger i might have rejoiced in them as my own and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt but no recollecting herself that could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me i should not have been allowed to invite them this was a lucky recollectionit saved her from something like regret	7.417002524592183
it was not in their direct road nor more than a mile or two out of it	6.834237874752231
darcy she cried i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter	8.480980941650664
it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonels family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best	6.201596273326088
when i went away i felt that it would soon happen that is to say you had given your permission	9.288685653120336
easter was approaching and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at rosings which in so small a circle must be important	7.82672829876591
bennet wondered at their coming and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble and was sure jane would have caught cold again but their father though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure was really glad to see them he had felt their importance in the family circle	7.242163290406485
collins first came to hunsford i believe she didand i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object mr	5.893546808382074
how he must have felt it i never saw any one so shocked	9.152308177186134
but as it isyou must not let your fancy run away with you	6.7663569947550615
in three volumes	4.896002348037563
the evening conversation when they were all assembled had lost much of its animation and almost all its sense by the absence of jane and elizabeth	6.882348052352801
in spite of this amendment however she requested to have a note sent to longbourn desiring her mother to visit jane and form her own judgment of her situation	7.603041634226423
darcy took up a book miss bingley did the same and mrs	6.61407215302949
it was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried	7.3642775236059785
i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in some confusion lest they had been overheard	8.020447301262621
he is comemr	6.554425391703746
wickhams adieus were much more affectionate than his wifes	5.407308843430452
i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being informed that she was very accomplished your list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy has too much truth	7.09792224995465
there shut into her own room as soon as their visitor left them she could think without interruption of all that she had heard	8.500428699449918
in the first place she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter secondly she was very sure that mr	6.5898488135693665
it was to be such a secret if it was to be secret said jane say not another word on the subject	7.968087192234003
is this to be endured	10.556159429662587
in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour	6.161850667217313
is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year not so much as i could wish sir but i dare say he may spend half his time here and miss darcy is always down for the summer months except thought elizabeth when she goes to ramsgate if your master would marry you might see more of him yes sir but i do not know when that will be	7.849999213968058
but gracious me	6.047988180190874
miss bennets pleasing manners grew on the good will of mrs	7.035996535358338
it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended him still more and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him as well as by his evident admiration of her of her former favourite george wickham and though in comparing them she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliams manners she believed he might have the best informed mind	7.921913877574891
you quite mistook mr	5.280924223331154
ten thousand a year and very likely more	6.533309392294205
elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyships entrance though no request of introduction had been made	7.9155660868176385
hope was over entirely over and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter she found little except the professed affection of the writer that could give her any comfort	7.324046120187279
if i had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called on him	8.430004798486191
my feelings will not be repressed	8.831900175518292
i must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music	9.119957693014932
darcy had much better finish his letter mr	5.788485266366209
elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest and then sick of this folly took refuge in her own room that she might think with freedom	7.070069403002164
he has also brotherly pride which with some brotherly affection makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers what sort of a girl is miss darcy he shook his head i wish i could call her amiable	5.787010523790139
but of course she did not mention my name to you yes she did and what did she say that you were gone into the army and she was afraid hadnot turned out well	8.555339473403736
in that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks and to mrs	8.109423573878173
poor charlotte it was melancholy to leave her to such society but she had chosen it with her eyes open and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go she did not seem to ask for compassion	8.569630333742191
the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements with such news as the country afforded but the latter half which was dated a day later and written in evident agitation gave more important intelligence	5.258727355601554
bennet alarmed	7.082334764407551
long does not keep a carriage and had come to the ball in a hack chaise i do not mind his not talking to mrs	7.8850080052718425
an hour however saw the whole completed and mr	6.286749329197695
i have not that pain	6.992821513582563
darcy they had only seen at church	6.742457011666745
miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense	5.63939891348823
collins has made you an offer of marriage	5.335072060257148
is not he a charming man	7.205253299591277
but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us	8.501101741176898
bennets consent should be asked in the course of the evening	8.755671265866958
she did not fear her fathers opposition but he was going to be made unhappy and that it should be through her means that she his favourite child should be distressing him by her choice should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her was a wretched reflection and she sat in misery till mr	6.95351593018841

bennet could not have chosen better	6.799657217827219
elizabeth listened as little as she could but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickhams name	7.2052103231578135
lord bless me	5.794255494199397
the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this	7.540764702290184
darcy corroborated it with a bow and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting	8.471469443530436
but it is not merely this affair she continued on which my dislike is founded	5.667068229392702

philips protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist enumerating all the dishes at supper and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house	6.238888645450696
affectation of candour is common enoughone meets it every where	3.6486078858236737

i am afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose mr	5.1467670661119005
elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately and jane who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit was delighted at her entrance	8.37245603059322
you have widely mistaken my character if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these	6.927031073957742
gardiner was so little to be trusted you must not blame my aunt	9.817008901787137
brighton and a whole campful of soldiers to us who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia and the monthly balls of meryton now i have got some news for you said lydia as they sat down to table	5.455628944817372
darcy liked me less his son might have borne with me better but his fathers uncommon attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in life	5.8318418375350705

my sister who is more than ten years my junior was left to the guardianship of my mothers nephew colonel fitzwilliam and myself	6.869294211887489
she had high animal spirits and a sort of natural selfconsequence which the attentions of the officers to whom her uncles good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her had increased into assurance	5.65023446827568
elizabeth loved absurdities but she had known sir williams too long	6.298762720584389
poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder	5.572739620866433
an union of a different tendency and precluding the possibility of the other was soon to be formed in their family	8.27743994653173

there was one part especially the opening of it which i should dread your having the power of reading again	6.08296055172275
for she only came i suppose to tell us the collinses were well	7.515332756869982
i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit	7.092989601866943

he was as generous she doubted not as the most generous of his sex	7.332607725604237

charlotte herself was tolerably composed	5.612759640260674

in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more and turning to elizabeth said miss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the room i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately	6.8110532770426575
he resigned all claim to assistance in the church were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it and accepted in return three thousand pounds	7.665981810916634
when she did come it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it she made a slight formal apology for not calling before said not a word of wishing to see me again and was in every respect so altered a creature that when she went away i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer	8.09013903503189
wickham after a few moments touched his hata salutation which mr	4.24900736253869

they were rather handsome had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds were in the habit of spending more than they ought and of associating with people of rank and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others	5.7851809133495795
let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue while in town for the recovery of his daughter	6.9751508529197315
she coloured as she spoke but neither that nor any thing else awakened a suspicion of the truth	6.173051671279516
it was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention	8.425228658488878
with a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility and to imitate his politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her might be mischievously construed	6.824127074506139
allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was illjudged	7.480402708338706
from the very beginning from the first moment i may almost say of my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form that groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry you have said quite enough madam	7.214346178395504
her liveliness had been never worse timed	6.064070210737194
darcy chose to doubt itor to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance imprudence in short any thing or nothing	5.479846392028179
but i knew noti was afraid of doing too much	6.154798200580007

darcy had been at her sisters wedding	10.387966148692218
if it was not allowable for him to gain my affections because i had no money what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equally poor but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe	6.03819651865748
he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate generous heart in the world and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted	7.165857667688758

she would not betray her trust i suppose without bribery and corruption for she really did know where her friend was to be found	6.212936971496392
darcy and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr	9.129307660815858

he was fond of the country and of books and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments	6.757238916025231
you are not well enoughyou cannot go yourself elizabeth hesitated but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them	5.5770752275314965
so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him	6.65020764154024
darcy might have been doing to forward her sisters match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true	6.375212541222578

no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph	6.130674530120177
mary was obliged to mix more with the world but she could still moralize over every morning visit and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters beauty and her own it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance	8.217186912309698
elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mothers	8.923622484289389
i have not been used to submit to any persons whims	6.000044160790895
i had not believed it possible i suspected as much replied elizabeth	6.938219411704069

at length quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his she gave a great yawn and said how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way	8.729261010706026
i am sure you will be very comfortable there	6.569906343762334
what an agreeable man sir william is mr	6.2038047074544815
at such a moment the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought when she saw mr	7.688386260388062
lady catherine observed after dinner that miss bennet seemed out of spirits and immediately accounting for it herself by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon she added but if that is the case you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer	8.623089796162294

surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement	10.68390551035989
darcy himself but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance and in all that he said she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day	5.710214999915571
i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment that will make your ladyships situation at present more pitiable but it will have no effect on me i will not be interrupted	7.078188773507714

bennets property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year which unfortunately for his daughters was entailed in default of heirs male on a distant relation and their mothers fortune though ample for her situation in life could but ill supply the deficiency of his	4.517504935867881
elizabeth construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased and on this account as well as some others found herself when their visitors left them capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little	7.181094882943362
the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance and miss lucas who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon that establishment were gained	5.121181889340704

jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again	7.735144183156755
bennet deigned not to make any reply but unable to contain herself began scolding one of her daughters	6.556519560017694
her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman and he was thinking of her with some complacency when thus accosted by miss bingley i can guess the subject of your reverie i should imagine not you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this mannerin such society and indeed i am quite of your opinion	7.821084222113974
i was so vexed to see him stand up with her but however he did not admire her at all indeed nobody can you know and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance	8.880973054409386
why must their marriage be private	5.534504292815547
and that i suppose is one of your sisters yes madam said mrs	8.035170470015977
darcy appeared again when looking at him she was a little relieved by his smile	8.68268128165045
you must not suspect me	5.870924985642264
darcy and mr	5.357076100568623
they are wanted in the farm mr	6.3900334848561355
darcy or at least by the predominance of virtue atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what mr	4.915177131013669
in a short time i shall have a daughter married	9.725202779912033
contributions to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by u s	4.347027853938156
darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property	10.194929843758
one has got all the goodness and the other all the appearance of it i never thought mr	10.047994767199746
could there be finer symptoms	5.357189256799842
collins were once silent	4.8635046486291476
catherine weakspirited irritable and completely under lydias guidance had been always affronted by their advice and lydia selfwilled and careless would scarcely give them a hearing	4.310776578790624
darcy and lizzy and kitty said mrs	5.945609831494734
one ought not to repinebut to be sure it would have been such a thing for me	9.350723425530738
her astonishment however was extreme and continually was she repeating why is he so altered	4.799077948526181
are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted you can now have nothing farther to say she resentfully answered	6.555896054987941
in talking over their route the evening before mrs	5.682956284722747
i wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind	5.454606624996257
how can you be so silly cried her mother as to think of such a thing in all this dirt	10.00149840845464
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory	8.947382614165864
i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere	6.959322097641437
she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself in their first evening at mr	7.7185049607945215
i want to talk very seriously	6.851005389603167
collins on his return highly gratified mrs	5.993331008442411
darcy is engaged to my daughter	8.175216250392776
bingley whose blind partiality provoked her	4.365460496650321
lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won and mr	6.547312085545396
younge was of course removed from her charge	7.555035518643182
it was not all settled before monday as soon as it was the express was sent off to longbourn	6.527775497663506
she wanted to hear of him when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence	8.145589011358549
if you received the work electronically the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund	5.7808470784273345
darcy it ought to be good he replied it has been the work of many generations and then you have added so much to it yourself you are always buying books i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these neglect	7.699179026362781
darcy was here when you sent for uswas it so yes and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement	6.640999683159556
darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side and that if it were it must belong to mr	6.840439940468718
miss bennet had slept ill and though up was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room	7.392589096712512
miss darcy was tall and on a larger scale than elizabeth and though little more than sixteen her figure was formed and her appearance womanly and graceful	6.155448230986992
it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town and quitting them both he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton denominated from that period lucas lodge where he could think with pleasure of his own importance and unshackled by business occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world	6.769822869444057
your tempers are by no means unlike	5.0755750973048945
i am impatient to see him in point of composition said mary his letter does not seem defective	5.9002275862467215
much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle a private had been flogged and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married	7.589897520697257
but i pity her because she must feel that she has been acting wrong and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it	8.4527081945225
lizzy to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family	9.679764848991258
and for this we are to be thankful	11.914290986222174
philipss vulgarity was another and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance and though mrs	5.6656950248280245
i told mrs	5.991902865724301
i was obliged to confess one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him	7.121157950777252
darcys treatment of him she tried to remember something of that gentlemans reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it and was confident at last that she recollected having heard mr	6.3345946716655455
wickham we are brother and sister you know	8.480524598746738
hurst by whom elizabeth sat he was an indolent man who lived only to eat drink and play at cards who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout had nothing to say to her	5.292485502719657
he knows where we live	6.253312620443043
she shall hear my opinion mrs	6.317002520258734
i am very very sorry	6.188809606415178
the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence or frightened by his high and imposing manners and sees him only as he chuses to be seen i should take him even on my slight acquaintance to be an illtempered man wickham only shook his head	5.5841827609779076
the commendation bestowed on him by mrs	6.190225590989222
the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw	7.26786849214554
here comes hill	6.106098644641819
the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family	8.881324799415422
he comes down on thursday at the latest very likely on wednesday	5.432795292676133
but then i have always supposed it to be my own faultbecause i would not take the trouble of practising	8.177112391082805
wickham and herself	6.453359013995199
never intended to go there or to marry lydia at all which was repeated to colonel f	7.949910376347556
miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again of giving up the house but not with any certainty	7.885647390075604
darcy before they had known any thing of the matter	10.356685860854464
bingleys chaise to go to meryton and the hursts have no horses to theirs i had much rather go in the coach but my dear your father cannot spare the horses i am sure	6.883891812742433
they lagged behind while elizabeth kitty and darcy were to entertain each other	6.258909535315437
well i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr	6.867044496021317
charlotte had seen them from her husbands room crossing the road and immediately running into the other told the girls what an honour they might expect adding i may thank you eliza for this piece of civility	6.362537651216037
what will wickham say	5.854414117174979
such a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but gratitudefor to love ardent love it must be attributed and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means unpleasing though it could not be exactly defined	7.1755296667108075
when the gentlemen rose to go away mrs	6.280940573620942
at that instant she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion	6.0634748006394075
but it is all all too late now i am grieved indeed cried darcy grievedshocked	6.008214051429603
it drew from her however the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectually done before and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present	6.986228308728361
but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marryingand moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife as i certainly did the idea of mr	6.381094974887179
he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him and though his pride was hurt he suffered in no other way	6.4226890531370415
and it is the more to be lamented because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte informs me that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence though at the same time for the consolation of yourself and mrs	6.592653654914915
bennet in equal silence was enjoying the scene	4.637558647428698
darcy is over i presume said miss bingley and pray what is the result i am perfectly convinced by it that mr	6.485066112448696
bingley will like it lizzy we are not in a way to know what mr	8.052111652045122
he had rather hoped that all his wifes views on the stranger would be disappointed but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear	8.966195417351155
they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while ascended some of the higher grounds whence in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of the valley the opposite hills with the long range of woods overspreading many and occasionally part of the stream	5.469081626474494
darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance	5.120789025872891
i am sure you must feel it so oh	6.590506589248744
little more than half a days journey	7.228815747290324
why my dear you must know mrs	8.24583285920526
he promises fairly and i hope among different people where they may each have a character to preserve they will both be more prudent	5.821578794184885
the note was immediately dispatched and its contents as quickly complied with	4.309395689487163
to be sure london was rather thin but however the little theatre was open	5.757852811804693
pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself and with a low bow he left her to attack mr	5.635028079892496
and what do you think she said besides	8.48947672460026
wickhams happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer and mr	6.255759426157075
these bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by reflection by every thing	3.937302621573076
though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world he was caught by their easy playfulness	7.351772282827117
your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters my mother would have had no objection but my father hates london has your governess left you we never had any governess no governess	6.241873223982299
my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this	7.572066584083234
miss bingley moved with alacrity to the pianoforte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she seated herself	5.735425053026399
but perhaps mr	5.90369365637833
elizabeth who was left by herself now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation	5.950661924881831
it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration	7.713725962431526
elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes	5.297931364065038
gardiner could not be seen and mr	7.710964178629366
but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which case you may be sure of my pardon no replied jane i have not forgotten him but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you	8.422476749968931
what sister would think herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very objectionable	5.786975918648851
they were in street	7.00965480598897
darcy there is a fine old saying which every body here is of course familiar withkeep your breath to cool your porridge and i shall keep mine to swell my song her performance was pleasing though by no means capital	4.156254449375715
had i known what i ought what i dared to do	9.088514587401308
oh that i knew how it was but wishes were vain or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour	7.168017339691972
you may depend upon my seeking no further oh	4.489187451833986
not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcys meditated elopement	6.787633924727639
upon this signal the youngest of her daughters put herself forward	6.295030239173222
but these things happen so often	5.575709436287058
he never said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questionsabout her pleasure in being at hunsford her love of solitary walks and her opinion of mr	5.894291988297552
on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects	5.12028196300681
at length she spoke again	6.375886582200852
but lizzy you look as if you did not enjoy it	7.4738788185611655
bennets eyes sparkled with pleasure and she was eagerly calling out while her daughter read well jane who is it from	6.8566969976604355
she does not yet leave her dressingroom	8.358890266649457
the strangeness of mr	4.522831229771692
his regard for her was quite imaginary and the possibility of her deserving her mothers reproach prevented his feeling any regret	7.88816562487361
after wandering along the lane for two hours giving way to every variety of thought reconsidering events determining probabilities and reconciling herself as well as she could to a change so sudden and so important fatigue and a recollection of her long absence made her at length return home and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation	6.215127194106819
bingley and his sisters elizabeth answered only by a slight bow	6.6739910630326715
we can all plague and punish one another	4.164332791919481
good or bad what is there of good to be expected said he taking the letter from his pocket but perhaps you would like to read it elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand	7.752065728089104
but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them	7.196021526710693
tis as good as a lord	7.618725794307255
my dear charles what do you mean yes all of them i think	7.08404379085879
multiple superscripted characters are enclosed by curly brackets example mrs	2.696697534288436
gardiners door jane was at a drawingroom window watching their arrival when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them and elizabeth looking earnestly in her face was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever	6.277420447490012
collins was not a sensible man and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father and though he belonged to one of the universities he had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful acquaintance	5.855024738352264
does your charge give you much trouble	6.562979107915945
i was ready to die of laughter	5.614969401575878
he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man he certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible but to counterbalance these advantages mr	5.193560207047987
on their being joined by mr	6.859745556445236
could he expect that her friends would not step forward	8.964151431818527
let me hear from you very soon	6.009648270346208
darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer and therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage	6.179358250318218
philips was always glad to see her nieces and the two eldest from their recent absence were particularly welcome and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home which as their own carriage had not fetched them she should have known nothing about if she had not happened to see mr	6.538571888022146
they will ruin your happiness	5.119280087634302
darcy she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her	4.844309003839747
the reason why all this was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above	9.085099292628868
the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr	8.028204428840315
at such a distance as that you know things are strangely misrepresented certainly he replied biting his lips	5.999835966776501
collins and charlotte appeared at the door and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party	6.9776878499704695
miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose	8.179984756703176
if he wants our society let him seek it	4.801221831920458
i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday her daughter miss de bourgh will have a very large fortune and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates this information made elizabeth smile as she thought of poor miss bingley	7.714202536145608
the garden sloping to the road the house standing in it the green pales and the laurel hedge every thing declared they were arriving	6.941536933643563
they must all go to brighton	6.390165904458866
and so would anne if her health had allowed her to apply	6.032012825880242
elizabeth equally next to jane in birth and beauty succeeded her of course	6.490291701277577
darcy was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat	7.407357619757973
darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of him	8.762553229783665
bingley she had likewise seen for an instant and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed	6.399725364087516
bennet was stirring the fire	4.864953953687037
darcy was attending them to their carriage miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeths person behaviour and dress	4.66964619098783
it is not of peculiar but of general evils which i am now complaining	6.427877308965086
darcy no indeed i did not i knew nothing at all of lady catherines connections	8.186275398101056
there is but such a quantity of merit between them just enough to make one good sort of man and of late it has been shifting about pretty much	6.360880859500233
kitty run down and order the carriage	5.660173610995329
bingley was the principal spokesman and miss bennet the principal object	7.926265460263436
he could not speak a word for full ten minutes	6.522450358669906
their visitors staid with them above half an hour and when they arose to depart mr	5.506136350972299
darcy the superior in consequence to begin the acquaintance mr	5.17866325868416
bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in momentary dread bingley who wanted to be alone with jane proposed their all walking out	6.759298248195009
had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr	6.82364965808673
good gracious	7.202314525165696
she wanted to talk but there seemed an embargo on every subject	5.745641700341911
i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister	6.353507394627233
i shall now know how to act	7.105006823341966
his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind	12.114633877395667
mary and kitty thank heaven	5.4876051203597465
bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice	5.916405050062489
but to be sure the good lady who shewed us the house did give him a most flaming character	6.895451172967077
two of her girls had been on the point of marriage and after all there was nothing in it	11.20619764397054
i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park	7.718772852209641
that he was surprised by the connexion was evident he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with mr	5.982789464316399
my avowed one or what i avowed to myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to befall her i am more likely to want time than courage elizabeth	6.875695329073989
in ran mrs	5.580946431162746
dear dear lizzy	8.594549767441535
but his pride his abominable pride his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he could not justify it and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr	6.590454889470143
elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship	7.137402103770521
there are a lot of things you can do with project gutenbergtm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to project gutenbergtm electronic works	4.612112168386372
balls will be absolutely prohibited unless you stand up with one of your sisters	7.0763877210630035
lady catherines great attentions to mrs	5.858266612751623
but enough of this	9.484165109414626
with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say she began his account of what had happened at netherfield	8.105778741316817
she opened the door and met maria in the landing place who breathless with agitation cried out oh my dear eliza	4.95234941261112
the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlottes situation and his expectation of a young olivebranch	8.38923226425528
let me thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the sake of discovering them if you will thank me he replied let it be for yourself alone	6.781286458024285
she expressed her gratitude again but it was too painful a subject to each to be dwelt on farther	7.421350392477011
but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr	7.098730403928941
she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news and telling again what had been already written and when it closed elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlottes degree of contentment to understand her address in guiding and composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it was all done very well	5.689129944479867
her sisters were uneasy for her but her mother was delighted	10.673087450020876
oh lizzy	6.655461070171176
you take delight in vexing me	5.394855393729474
they called at various times of the morning sometimes separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their aunt	6.118876768851633
intending to trace their route	6.195085839497011
she became jealous of his esteem when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it	8.630602537721826
bingley when i am in the country he replied i never wish to leave it and when i am in town it is pretty much the same	12.43774016872769
her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way	7.2486477445198645
no hatred had vanished long ago and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him that could be so called	6.953443169574778
it was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind	5.981939644657135
if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once	9.021403938139894
in three volumes	4.896002348037563
nay said elizabeth this is not fair	9.841156125261985
i told my sister philips so the other day	6.64213319678341
with many compliments to them and much selfgratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses he unfolded the matter to an audience not merely wondering but incredulous for mrs	5.745516914536314
he cannot know what mr	5.9867989988027865
you can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format with its attached full project gutenbergtm license when you share it without charge with others	5.636162998550019
however i recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going the wedding need not be put off for mr	6.133125701828989
ten thousand a year	5.749369969128744
miss bingleys attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr	7.541411503141025
collinss picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest	7.81735664368299
i did not think mrs	6.307282367361467
our instrument is a capital one probably superior toyou shall try it some day do your sisters play and sing one of them does why did not you all learn you ought all to have learned	5.412066669360499
darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at the ball and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise	8.217552702974011
a younger son you know must be inured to selfdenial and dependence in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little of either	6.099044934751314
collins too why should he have it more than anybody else i leave it to yourself to determine said mr	6.081612838485674
she was shewn into the breakfastparlour where all but jane were assembled and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise that she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to mrs	6.172538014561578
no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there	3.3063612377656315
at present however i consider myself as quite fixed here that is exactly what i should have supposed of you said elizabeth	6.877899977059027
that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate	8.461183061840616
the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly	4.075077896437326
darcys eyes were fixed on her	6.761918762204854
how is such a man to be worked on	9.316015061066244
elizabeth felt janes pleasure	6.538897581393409
he replied and was again silent	9.383701830750393
one came from her books and the other from her toilette	10.639208946136455
while in their cradles we planned the union and now at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth of no importance in the world and wholly unallied to the family	7.110805158967767
darcy that they scarcely ever saw him	8.385332498691389
i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never had any design of engaging my affection	6.193951862641331
i am so pleasedso happy	4.532119449258134
she accounted for it however by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been lost	7.2303134771282584
the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth	4.3937259310465935
she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town had there renewed a slight acquaintance	7.539253703937234
they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable	7.2807843112883495
wickham will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to anybody here what he really is	6.390644006107943
i ought not to have said a word about it	9.154734595218502
elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great ladys attention which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others	4.957773212618151
certainly said elizabeth though burning with curiosity we will ask you no questions thank you said lydia for if you did i should certainly tell you all and then wickham would be angry on such encouragement to ask elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power by running away	7.302402465578786
at length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself	6.828251238977767
on sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to almost all took place	4.566687504078357
the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken	6.415990161915076
yet why did he come she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself and to him she had hardly courage to speak	8.920720542858968
bingley to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day before	7.629179426000105
i often tell my other girls they are nothing to her	6.773361098965192
i have not the smallest hope	5.6570067930236085
another day i will do the same i will sit in my library in my night cap and powdering gown and give as much trouble as i can or perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away i am not going to run away papa said kitty fretfully if i should ever go to brighton i would behave better than lydia you go to brighton i would not trust you so near it as east bourne for fifty pounds	5.949589200703428
bennets being quite unable to sit alone	5.574767545459332
i have more than once observed to lady catherine that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess and that the most elevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned by her these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay you judge very properly said mr	5.928212090959291
and if you will stay another month complete it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london for i am going there early in june for a week and as dawson does not object to the barouche box there will be very good room for one of youand indeed if the weather should happen to be cool i should not object to taking you both as you are neither of you large you are all kindness madam but i believe we must abide by our original plan lady catherine seemed resigned	7.036024864964352
i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one	6.749377827751737
it was exactly a scene and exactly among people where he had apparently least to do and least temptation to go	5.530822450240529
royalty payments must be paid within NUM days following each date on which you prepare or are legally required to prepare your periodic tax returns	4.04344933983756
elizabeth was surprised however that wickham should consent to such a scheme and had she consulted only her own inclination any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes	8.797956940520343
he walked away again immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind charlotte tried to console her	6.500749786176125
she was not sorry however to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung	8.055487341397798
they repulsed every attempt of mrs	4.59267995684214
in society so superior to what she had generally known her improvement was great	6.394407557493102
my youngest of all is lately married and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds walking with a young man who i believe will soon become a part of the family you have a very small park here returned lady catherine after a short silence	7.081756434417792
you tear them to pieces kitty has no discretion in her coughs said her father she times them ill i do not cough for my own amusement replied kitty fretfully	5.636974025814503
darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his cousins corroboration	7.471139507320163
what a pity it is mamma we did not all go very true and if i had my will we should	8.073317880265703
yet he is such a man yes yes they must marry	8.442231689418167
bennet looking as unconcerned as may be and caring no more for us than if we were at york provided she can have her own way but i tell you what miss lizzy if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way you will never get a husband at alland i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead i shall not be able to keep youand so i warn you i have done with you from this very day i told you in the library you know that i should never speak to you again and you will find me as good as my word	7.240961760899681
this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself miss bennet still looked all amazement	6.862375048901788
long is as good a creature as ever livedand her nieces are very pretty behaved girls and not at all handsome i like them prodigiously mrs	5.5206189105799695
their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this	5.4340281723357124
denny and mr	5.400627843960323
i thought we never should have got into the coach	7.709407800794503
with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms	10.723408593888804
bennet who quarrelled with no compliments answered most readily you are very kind sir i am sure and i wish with all my heart it may prove so for else they will be destitute enough	5.90980913707875
limited warranty disclaimer of damages except for the right of replacement or refund described in paragraph NUM f NUM the project gutenberg literary archive foundation the owner of the project gutenbergtm trademark and any other party distributing a project gutenbergtm electronic work under this agreement disclaim all liability to you for damages costs and expenses including legal fees	3.755490195954433
well any friend of mr	5.3539345551943
not however from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself for at any rate there seemed a gulf impassable between them	4.502079588106874
as soon as all had ate and the elder ones paid the carriage was ordered and after some contrivance the whole party with all their boxes workbags and parcels and the unwelcome addition of kittys and lydias purchases were seated in it	5.083819539691162
darcy called and was shut up with him several hours	7.023338798208369
but to be candid without ostentation or designto take the good of every bodys character and make it still better and say nothing of the badbelongs to you alone	6.390876558397324
perhaps there was some truth in this though i doubt whether his reserve or anybodys reserve can be answerable for the event	7.109417897165934
seriously i would have you be on your guard	9.656654909497032
she then took a large house in edwardstreet and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings	4.791204412263555
it is a grievous affair to my poor girls you must confess	6.605241225720076
i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies	6.6170933058413155
to know that her daughter would be married was enough	11.68355639845069
i should like to know how he behaves among strangers you shall hear thenbut prepare yourself for something very dreadful	4.677642005859617
you had much better dance i certainly shall not	8.187720187129358
if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside cried bingley it would not make them one jot less agreeable but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world replied darcy	6.415693196068934
but he added you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here elizabeth made no objectionthe door was then allowed to be shut and the carriage drove off	8.701835820521953
that he was really fond of jane she doubted no more than she had ever done and much as she had always been disposed to like him she could not think without anger hardly without contempt on that easiness of temper that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations	7.364640376040521
but i can guess how it was every body says that he is ate up with pride and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs	8.177595813953113
he is the best landlord and the best master said she that ever lived	8.353240866378876
if the second copy is also defective you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem	3.852901176780307
i hardly know how mr	6.2539256144063575
from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink	10.237757792600588
i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish my dear mr	6.056788119961561
wickham and of what he had told her all the way home but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went for neither lydia nor mr	8.315173728256509
this madam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together and if you do not absolutely reject it as false you will i hope acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr	6.478439966910655
how you must have hated me after that evening hate you	5.976971381119727
his affection was proved to have been sincere and his conduct cleared of all blame unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend	6.941777525039497
here sarah come to miss bennet this moment and help her on with her gown	8.327243407546918
bennet with little cessation of his house and garden at hunsford	6.258933631363823
she had known it seems of their being in love with each other many weeks but not before they went to brighton no i believe not and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself	7.399074869393804
the families who had been in town for the winter came back again and summer finery and summer engagements arose	6.17808402723856
indeed you are mistaken madam	8.364740572916592
there can be no occasion for your going so soon	7.357663463640869
it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded	8.043031299739058
elizabeth jumped out and after giving each of them an hasty kiss hurried into the vestibule where jane who came running down stairs from her mothers apartment immediately met her	5.358635223019952
had she found jane in any apparent danger mrs	6.774058045099857
this match to which you have the presumption to aspire can never take place	5.872071978220596
elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor were the other ladies often absent the gentlemen being out they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere	7.220854275008562
collins i think	8.328095592514781
society has claims on us all and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body elizabeths spirits were so high on the occasion that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr	5.739169295148204
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too	8.670673300247136
i never saw such a long chin in my life	7.023392091278949
anne would have been a delightful performer had her health allowed her to learn elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousins praise but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley that he might have been just as likely to marry her had she been his relation	7.185870995146246
darcy of pemberley and lady anne could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner i am excessively attentive to all those things	6.89102586628789
kitty then owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydias last letter she had prepared her for such a step	7.988426612534129
and it was not wholly without foundation	7.317978989047091
she will not be able to help calling she will drop the acquaintance entirely but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point as well as the still more interesting one of bingleys being withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely hopeless	6.555623909869721
you have reduced him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty	6.895528559488308
we will know where we have gonewe will recollect what we have seen	6.38590696765279
he was very fond of them this accounted to elizabeth for mr	7.463484218852831
lizzy is not a bit better than the others and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half so good humoured as lydia	8.06479833972434
collins and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend met her with every appearance of composure	7.628220694977147
gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure but as his brother was eager in it he meant to assist him in pursuing it	6.971239716634215
but the gentlemen will have mr	7.608185730150895
you shall hear what she says she then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street where mr	5.950585425198033
in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence	6.717989208887538
the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees	8.9323229816112
i suppose you have heard of it indeed you must have seen it in the papers	11.634853556428494
you were not by when i told mamma and the others all about it	9.04972443965883
and poor mr	5.610959976076761
i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sisters infamous elopement	6.622309362682575
collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance to the young ladies he certainly was nothing but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs	6.0802593841533
thoughtless thoughtless lydia cried elizabeth when she had finished it	6.542275092750139
these recollections will not do at all	8.836570557473184
did he know of their intending to go off	10.674834626544264
oh lizzy	6.655461070171176
bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house	6.546283687145212
she asked her at different times how many sisters she had whether they were older or younger than herself whether any of them were likely to be married whether they were handsome where they had been educated what carriage her father kept and what had been her mothers maiden name elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly lady catherine then observed your fathers estate is entailed on mr	6.225300631402245
she wished to discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming this must be false	5.4621361548040195
elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between mr	6.059918283880258
how can you be smiling so lizzy their affectionate mother shared all their grief she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion five and twenty years ago	4.659059886618086
bingley said her husband it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life this roused a general astonishment and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once	8.26410686161305
you are each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on so easy that every servant will cheat you and so generous that you will always exceed your income i hope not so	6.6720807945189495
my good qualities are under your protection and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible and in return it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last	6.500214858419596
a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern	9.625830084609806
her uncle and aunt were all amazement and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and many of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on the business	10.584939903245546
why should they try to influence him	4.9975843644324245
gardiner though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause could not avoid recommending moderation to her as well in her hopes as her fears and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper who attended in the absence of her daughters	9.561667102591274
but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was	3.601393559377979
no never	7.875560134899124
our poor mother is sadly grieved	5.518293797931148
you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them is that his design in settling here design	8.624140983443892
darcy by coming in all this state to hear me	6.613582198458298
nicholls was in meryton last night i saw her passing by and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it and she told me that it was certain true	7.851787689375091
i thought i should have broke my heart i am sure i shall break mine said lydia	6.222096404281261
had they been only ten minutes sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination for it was plain that he was that moment arrived that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage	6.71378344212445
his sister was less delicate and directed her eye towards mr	5.088021394827508
it was my brother gardiners drawing up too and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it	7.73519933892533
have a little compassion on my nerves	8.645114146567696
bennet who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen	9.250122068222648
she has known him only a fortnight	7.701137384112239
with no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosity elizabeth opened the letter and to her still increasing wonder perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper written quite through in a very close hand the envelope itself was likewise full pursuing her way along the lane she then began it	4.731229507982831
if i may so express it he has a right to be proud that is very true replied elizabeth and i could easily forgive his pride if he had not mortified mine pride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections is a very common failing i believe	7.364977156156166
they were hopeless of remedy	5.426693364875071
what would she have said how would she have behaved were questions with which she amused herself	5.472284431631489
you begin to comprehend me do you cried he turning towards her	6.484057779787457
if one could but go to brighton observed mrs	5.535190884916268
collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st	6.646324879193067
she had dressed with more than usual care and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening	7.917674313155085
miss bingleys letter arrived and put an end to doubt	4.95731905515323
i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading	5.813432600202378
the visit was returned in due form	4.98595916772435
i am sure she added if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffers a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest temper i ever met with	7.365631486301624
when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying yet merited reproach her sense of shame was severe	7.003975295729852
and pray lizzy what said lady catherine about this report	5.7631971677276885
certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man and no less certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it	8.657679858566322
after an affectionate parting between the friends elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr	7.324443011991198
my father began life in the profession which your uncle mr	6.848135416722529
she was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation	5.444178319217451
the vicious propensitiesthe want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments which mr	6.2611489403581695
the business of her life was to get her daughters married its solace was visiting and news	6.623467760891394
it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy	6.766047999681353
its business office is located at NUM north NUM west salt lake city ut NUM NUM NUMNUM	2.6708892732705762
i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir	6.341718034301576
my aunts intelligence had given me hope and i was determined at once to know every thing lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy for she loves to be of use	7.825609216568369
i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here and i was convinced of her affection and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to him it did	9.14605829804664
darcys shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sisters sufferings	6.945724450196907
jones says we must not think of moving her	6.756163626887406
they were of course all intending to be surprised but their astonishment was beyond their expectation and on the part of mrs	6.995083960166448
the next morning as she was going down stairs she was met by her father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand	11.76296533061675
i will think no more about him her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister who joined her with a cheerful look which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors than elizabeth	7.037810421109722
nothing had ever suggested it before but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece	7.460254273658028
it is what every body says	7.061951958026615
darcys objections and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend	8.087196302293918
i never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses	5.417665482746255
he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady catherines discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily	7.402880679130479
mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball	8.666466065336138
have not you always hated him how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable her expressions more moderate	6.578119366858012
i was afraid they might not and we overtook william goulding in his curricle so i was determined he should know it and so i let down the side glass next to him and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window frame so that he might see the ring and then i bowed and smiled like any thing elizabeth could bear it no longer	6.397942420213519
the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him	9.017486841018144
i wonder said he at the next opportunity of speaking whether he is likely to be in this country much longer i do not at all know but i heard nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield	11.081732295354774
i am sure my sisters must all envy me	4.554855521278981
elizabeth made no answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr	7.19887909286511
but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there	6.784068991196237
such were the gentle murmurs of mrs	4.359470772192892
i believed you to be wishing expecting my addresses my manners must have been in fault but not intentionally i assure you	5.780749727151599
collins and mr	5.011250683036435
well lizzy said mrs	6.1873333649430515
wickham is safe and mary king is safe added elizabeth safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune she is a great fool for going away if she liked him but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side said jane	5.933129905463531
egerton military library whitehall	3.7347325379486667
it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case that is not an unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam but it is lessening the honour of my cousins triumph very sadly this was spoken jestingly but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr	7.0785040885233155
her pale face and impetuous manner made him start and before he could recover himself enough to speak she in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydias situation hastily exclaimed i beg your pardon but i must leave you	4.889902012530581
ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either detection could not be in your power and suspicion certainly not in your inclination	7.242269207368701
collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery	8.94395815416337
i am not at all afraid of her dying	8.745875362496946
let me first see how he behaves said she it will then be early enough for expectation she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to lift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door	6.069972015706636
wickham was as far beyond them all in person countenance air and walk as they were superior to the broadfaced stuffy uncle philips breathing port wine who followed them into the room	5.595767547214298
but elizabeth was not formed for illhumour and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening it could not dwell long on her spirits and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas whom she had not seen for a week she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin and to point him out to her particular notice	8.729971412974741
gardiner was a sensible gentlemanlike man greatly superior to his sister as well by nature as education	7.391695970852514
lydias thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars	9.746107288332304
any other inconsistencies with modern spellings have been left as printed	5.2132195342540495
however he wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently	8.802734312828473
bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be civil also and say what the occasion required	6.657643618862361
a young man such as you describe mr	7.856471389361556
it certainly is a most iniquitous affair said mr	5.670402222552358
all this was acknowledged to mrs	8.249303965584218
in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty and while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper go to your father he wants you in the library she was gone directly	7.837201071141586
the moment of her release from him was ecstacy	8.796928264517337
if i were not afraid of judging harshly i should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this	7.069252017519168
you never see a fault in any body	6.639037690467662
she is a handsome girl about fifteen or sixteen and i understand highly accomplished	5.068325958995229
it was a subject in short on which reflection would be long indulged and must be unavailing	6.963803264823532
it was all over before i arrived so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as yours seems to have been	6.0347087109144
he only told me what i have now told you elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling with indignation	7.019006954946221
the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side	4.8898307148313815
darcy approaching them and at no great distance	8.765540609675696
the communication excited many professions of concern and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane and till the morrow their going was deferred	5.630609109184843
jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention	7.212576970838326
when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters and elizabeth began to like them herself when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for jane	8.579113013121688
hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep	6.752541650885717
your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of ignorance	6.384254874160021
you know i have	12.217621291751508
i knew it to be a most respectable agreeable corps and my friend denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them	5.998430065703401
as a child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my temper	7.324986553552267
i know very well madam said he that when persons sit down to a card table they must take their chance of these things and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object	6.094138565983441
i was uncomfortable enough	5.861757855516282
lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when mr	6.541690324576503
i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soon as she allowed him to speak	6.568667369906504
illustration a vicarage house pride and prejudice a novel	3.5682641896062743
such a circumstance could only exasperate farther and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks and she said in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequally they may be returned	6.485122288448173
they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in and her uncle and aunt leaving her to enjoy them in quiet set off by themselves	7.229165912681158
philips as well as her sister stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingleys good humour encouraged yet whenever she did speak she must be vulgar	7.53510120178243
in the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries which jane was equally eager to satisfy	7.778497394955856
gardiners house where they were to remain a few days	7.629273455312912
when the ladies returned to the drawingroom there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk which she did without any intermission till coffee came in delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted	7.787697778433753
she had always felt that charlottes opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage	6.116889351094316
bingleys continued absence	6.234249061778685
jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for wickham resentment against his enemies and every thing else gave way before the hope of janes being in the fairest way for happiness	6.139666282138429
i ask only a comfortable home and considering mr	5.542218868062825
i am all astonishment	5.852955184665569
had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcys opinion and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps	6.35758503055889
after sitting a little while with jane on miss bingleys appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour	5.372568571164642
stay stay i will go myself	7.405002162593678
perhaps other people have said so before but not one with such justice	8.636031726412604
she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune part from her authoritative manner and the rest from the pride of her nephew who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr	6.735900597046784
bennet but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befal you you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it mr	7.581346669379774
i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford	5.636879373191769
wickham and the officers mr	9.12346346210829
why especially when you called did you look as if you did not care about me because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement but i was embarrassed and so was i you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner a man who had felt less might how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it	8.041859335095245
kitty to her very material advantage spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters	8.329363681849483
collinss happiness and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too	7.64472597446836
i have every reason in the world to think ill of you	7.947746546749243
not a soul knew of it but col	7.299668432374286
gardiner declared his willingness and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation	7.127717862772268
my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly to try to discover her	6.2280453418729165
the foundations principal office is located at NUM melan dr	3.1308227561375572
i hope we may often meet again elizabeth smiled	5.515729850630311
the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity	5.423240833364111
she is happy then said her father drily and her residence there will probably be of some duration then after a short silence he continued lizzy i bear you no illwill for being justified in your advice to me last may which considering the event shews some greatness of mind they were interrupted by miss bennet who came to fetch her mothers tea	6.085486365057123
darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance of his having ten thousand a year	6.273627297833581
collins was at leisure to look around him and admire and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification but when mrs	7.221124081498635
unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of janes happiness and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover she could not prevent its frequently recurring	6.8730065316298745
in truth i must acknowledge that with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings and he was obliged to walk about the room while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences	7.137719270786745
the loo table however did not appear	6.47698303344164
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too was another very welcome surprise for his chief wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible	7.446308012603567
i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up	6.358479791649017
i have nothing to say against him he is a most interesting young man and if he had the fortune he ought to have i should think you could not do better	10.03805876434986
bingley was punctual to his appointment and he and mr	6.320156070667887
she has no money no connections nothing that can tempt him toshe is lost for ever darcy was fixed in astonishment	4.372356345449794
you need not	7.954435535977094
no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think any thing wanting	8.723369190196248
darcy about it if you had rather not	10.469932629307843
dear sir i must trouble you once more for congratulations	7.249668400786535
elizabeth was surprised but said not a word	5.962294749627269
gardiner began to wish to be at home it was settled that she and her children should go to london at the same time that mr	9.396268942427858
was not this some excuse for incivility if i was uncivil	6.915841451449887
for what do we live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn oh cried elizabeth i am excessively diverted	6.9753195879525505
collins you must marry	7.085704602553465
bingley and under your orders oh	5.351366531390588
i defy even sir william lucas himself to produce a more valuable soninlaw the loss of her daughter made mrs	5.612912034195401
in her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam	5.674551444243356
my excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment to mr	5.051456517376012
bennet had no turn for economy and her husbands love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income	4.625293940521152
to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a moment i cannot blame myself for having done thus much	6.395474586894492
consider how important every moment is in such a case let me write for you said jane if you dislike the trouble yourself i dislike it very much he replied but it must be done and so saying he turned back with them and walked towards the house	7.446636263834193
till i can forget his father i can never defy or expose him elizabeth honoured him for such feelings and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them	6.593442646555592
on his quitting the room she sat down unable to support herself and looking so miserably ill that it was impossible for darcy to leave her or to refrain from saying in a tone of gentleness and commiseration let me call your maid	5.568598253123158
we all know him to be a proud unpleasant sort of man but this would be nothing if you really liked him i do i do like him she replied with tears in her eyes i love him	9.070921425117055
for such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey	5.9013600591263575
three daughters married	8.002275581714438
i never saw such capacity and taste and application and elegance as you describe united mrs	4.088565405587711
you may remember what i told you on that point when first we talked of it they were now almost at the door of the house for she had walked fast to get rid of him and unwilling for her sisters sake to provoke him she only said in reply with a goodhumoured smile come mr	7.733177948223925
one seems so forlorn without them this is the consequence you see madam of marrying a daughter said elizabeth	5.350927486354283
gardiner who was several years younger than mrs	4.897323570477517
you must feel it and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me because you have always so much mr	7.497088720492265
and with regard to the resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former were excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moments concernand the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn and this is your real opinion	8.425187717204052
she is almost three and twenty	5.544296227921065
the particulars i reserve till we meet	5.677372960249698
bingley and a charming prospect over that gravel walk	5.635101538819998
well he is a very undeserving young manand i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now	8.247064777206157
this event had at last been despaired of but it was then too late to be saving	8.353780844844653
with your good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others	7.327678204399166
but he found in reply to this question that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country	5.692151661932978
the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention	6.64141295436669
i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals but to accept them is absolutely impossible	7.889274431627659
it may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement	6.20536975165462
this fine account of him whispered her aunt as they walked is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend perhaps we might be deceived that is not very likely our authority was too good on reaching the spacious lobby above they were shewn into a very pretty sittingroom lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to miss darcy who had taken a liking to the room when last at pemberley	6.364680810972241
it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way	6.014592489519866
i wish you had been there	7.749648939049368
after walking two or three times along that part of the lane she was tempted by the pleasantness of the morning to stop at the gates and look into the park	7.398826436883245
it will then be publicly seen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance yes very indifferent indeed said elizabeth laughingly	4.5811105736515545
for a few moments indeed she felt that he would probably strike into some other path	6.795568246874092
she was at least free from the offence of mr	6.979088233484871
bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by the following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the waroffice another regiment should be quartered in meryton	5.922565696838733
gardiner looked at her niece desirous of knowing how she whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its acceptance but elizabeth had turned away her head	5.5069566498465905
bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments	6.227637899051296
bennet and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly the boy protested that she should not she continued to declare that she would and the argument ended only with the visit	8.073670715067147
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode and the improvements it was receiving he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them and he found in mrs	6.801321112993704
darcy whose pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friends connections than from their want of sense and she was quite decided at last that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride and partly by the wish of retaining mr	6.872609580891761
why if he came only to be silent grave and indifferent said she did he come at all she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure	9.57773223903877
forster and me are such friends and so she asked the two harringtons to come but harriet was ill and so pen was forced to come by herself and then what do you think we did	7.151907672704829
the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon	7.154282034962051
bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood it is more than i engage for i assure you but consider your daughters	8.961713816255157
elizabeth who had a letter to write went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea for as the others were all going to sit down to cards she could not be wanted to counteract her mothers schemes	7.162874222024168
at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here	7.780436055804664
elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it added to the hope of the future and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley	7.927321645365851
we have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house of which i hope you will approve	8.078096815978542
i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly	6.712264144466469
he cannot afford it	5.781090309380327
you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but i demand it of your justice	5.783033515324551
kitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on	5.93724296633351
is she handsome she is a most charming young lady indeed	7.3273847296720085
after watching her a little fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful	7.488030927187616
i wish you very happy and very rich and by refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise	6.0826823414158016
a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but half deserved all this she must possess added darcy and to all this she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women	6.544034795193752
i admire all my three sonsinlaw highly said he	5.795731832011085
i hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood oh	8.51743671551543
bennet came from it	7.734207898173259
what is it about	8.712344158965537
and then when we came away it was such fun	8.974120641702916
but these are not janes feelings she is not acting by design	7.607569768616071
elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs	3.928027964313699
i will take care of myself and of mr	7.023956015097883
would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress but i will not torment you with vain wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks	5.089509178340966
who is to fight wickham and make him marry her if he comes away as mrs	7.919999847991417
i am afraid you will not be able to make it out but i hardly know what i have written without allowing herself time for consideration and scarcely knowing what she felt elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other and opening it with the utmost impatience read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first	6.185739621288225
her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it she felt as if hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology hunsford and lady catherine de bourgh it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man	7.911960688067418
there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sisters frailty would have mortified her so much	7.083364907341853
darcy you saw me dance at meryton i believe sir yes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight	5.37078863268303
the lucases are very artful people indeed sister	4.863816372453168
she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at and it was rather too early to begin	6.76475874994605
not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded unless mr	6.032246458638869
if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew i shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh	8.200417749563115
at such a time much might have been said and silence was very awkward	8.046740420937782
adieu to disappointment and spleen	5.163790501589072
that is an uncommon advantage and uncommon i hope it will continue for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance	7.855477381277319
oh brother how kind you are	6.549109494398164
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself but his manners were always so pleasing that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought his smiles and his easy address while he claimed their relationship would have delighted them all	7.1074828114357
i will not tell you what it is	9.400358630320238
the envelope contained a sheet of elegant little hot pressed paper well covered with a ladys fair flowing hand and elizabeth saw her sisters countenance change as she read it and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages	5.046762690662448
bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day but though she always kept a very good table she did not think any thing less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand ayear	6.495275021424281
a most welcome negative followed the last questionand her alarms being now removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself and when the subject was revived the next morning and she was again applied to could readily answer and with a proper air of indifference that she had not really any dislike to the scheme	7.3410217339325365
the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade and within view of his own warehouses could have been so well bred and agreeable	7.125894355281662
heaven and earth of what are you thinking	6.754715683659756
you are safe from me there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil a natural defect which not even the best education can overcome and your defect is a propensity to hate every body and yours he replied with a smile is wilfully to misunderstand them do let us have a little music cried miss bingley tired of a conversation in which she had no share louisa you will not mind my waking mr	5.575304916311238
i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat	9.058913103387763
their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed or a really new muslin in a shop window could recal them	5.555615573981019
he begged pardon for having displeased her	5.085538306542457
i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help	6.429810616816115
bingley it was an animating subject and mrs	6.850902086904311
mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter	7.165706572357587
her ease and good spirits increased	6.298036483591424
no man of common humanity no man who had any value for his character could be capable of it	8.468692880557747
my child let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life	6.1899907890915875
here was knowledge in which no one could partake and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery	5.249277307963891
follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies do divert me i own and i laugh at them whenever i can but these i suppose are precisely what you are without perhaps that is not possible for any one	5.896328294513128
he placed himself by her	6.570207980770057
bennet the next morning but the post came in without bringing a single line from him	5.817737232028419
bingley who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it	7.807459281325172
i cannot do justice to his kindness	7.015672609689034
darcy she was directly retreating	7.365906215073956
but really i know not what to say	6.928842730597778
darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand but in vain	7.3547635768928865
it taught me to hope said he as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before	9.796062292197105
bennet for any thing about the entail	9.082553015968108
elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with great delight	6.837012474472295
elizabeth again and more seriously assured her of its truth	8.85465592380589
only let me assure you my dear miss elizabeth that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage	7.442687954891914
i am not ashamed of having been mistakenor at least it is slight it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters	7.983434392773256
as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females i do assure you sir that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man	6.767331256711531
we are not on friendly terms and it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason for avoiding him but what i might proclaim to all the world a sense of very great ill usage and most painful regrets at his being what he is	7.09800263980187
bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth i am glad you are come back lizzy their party in the diningroom was large for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news and various were the subjects which occupied them lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter mrs	5.751094743246585
the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london might be too much she feared for the strength of his attachment	8.840227762574829
darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunts ill breeding and made no answer	5.933890141221531
i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home and see if i can make it up any better and when her sisters abused it as ugly she added with perfect unconcern oh	6.685789239255283
soon after their return a letter was delivered to miss bennet it came from netherfield and was opened immediately	7.4389944691644905
what say you mary	7.00412005206988
they solaced their wretchedness however by duets after supper while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister	5.572489378160413
the gentlemen arrived early and before mrs	5.677302451430346
collinss addresses by engaging them towards herself	3.857783049374278
we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode	9.07170918181243
her own thoughts were employing her	6.492131155885758
we talked and laughed so loud that any body might have heard us ten miles off to this mary very gravely replied far be it from me my dear sister to depreciate such pleasures	5.000512359834196
who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable distrust how humiliating is this discovery yet how just a humiliation had i been in love i could not have been more wretchedly blind	4.806122174363592
you are very cautious i suppose as to its being created i am said he with a firm voice	8.818000511378328
i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction and nobody but a governess can give it	5.19137041839729
bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton	8.539594932785805
collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it	7.10386976018773
it cannot be	7.548782584875352
the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr	4.087514196198767
georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively sportive manner of talking to her brother	7.239613248288319
he came and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed	10.668507014956413
she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dancesand to have mr	4.408944112789029
fitzwilliam darcy chapter xiii	4.872856608931037
by the author of sense and sensibility vol	4.812746331316875
it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn before she told her sister of mr	6.123355560146503
he has the promise of an ensigncy in general s regiment now quartered in the north	6.02377413643125
and what claims has lydia what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well	4.94812087969545
and when i returned home the shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnights time	7.465143419439604
but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she added unhappy as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this useful lesson that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievablethat one false step involves her in endless ruinthat her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed to make any reply	4.821213221159276
my friend has an excellent understandingthough i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr	6.854163909854818
no kitty i have at last learnt to be cautious and you will feel the effects of it	8.995000918340994
gardiner wickham had one means of affording pleasure unconnected with his general powers	5.499647472528799
when after examining the mother in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr	4.517320472525665
bingleyis not he	7.336315150835383
elizabeth on her side had much to do	10.118845271756069
bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others and she had no opportunity of detaining them	6.14875885277849
i saw them the night before last elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling	8.095353391757044
elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to jane while mrs	6.192207702160045
collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character	7.016221542330143
mamma do the people here abouts know i am married today	5.637418962075316
bingley on the subject of the ball and abruptly reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it	8.176778528998996
NUM f NUM	4.3175970974974875
they travelled as expeditiously as possible and sleeping one night on the road reached longbourn by dinnertime the next day	4.212751321213403
this cannot be engaged to mr	6.104175247521815
they must have seen them together for ever colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality especially on lydias side but nothing to give him any alarm	6.0284375531730205
bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests	7.952817087251238
even elizabeth began to fearnot that bingley was indifferentbut that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away	6.355459175406815
darcys letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart	7.141142220925349
in NUM the project gutenberg literary archive foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for project gutenbergtm and future generations	3.4412302460494404
hurst in running away without telling us that you were coming out then taking the disengaged arm of mr	4.359929322938008
i remain dear sir with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters your wellwisher and friend william collins at four oclock therefore we may expect this peacemaking gentleman said mr	3.5957575743333314
how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned	7.198810087289468
you do not look well	7.444645266133974
i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say	5.286951515151712
london printed for t	4.316563445206013
elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply	8.038481573470898
no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both	6.795639254412055
darcy took her place by her niece and they walked on together	8.059680107163548
it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both by her ease and liveliness his mind might have been softened his manners improved and from his judgment information and knowledge of the world she must have received benefit of greater importance	7.386587472683031
eager to be alone and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley and then hurried away to dress	6.744678662983477
she enquired into charlottes domestic concerns familiarly and minutely and gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry	6.508119067216673
by this time she is actually with them	8.183621007749833
bennet half opened the door and called out lizzy my dear i want to speak with you elizabeth was forced to go	7.242510994180838
i should never be happy without him so think it no harm to be off	7.749101686002173
his letter was soon dispatched for though dilatory in undertaking business he was quick in its execution	5.932434354523102
he takes them now for people of fashion the introduction however was immediately made and as she named their relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore it and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions	6.4257048164529715
it was drawn at the same time as the otherabout eight years ago i have heard much of your masters fine person said mrs	6.338984850840527
when they ascended the steps to the hall marias alarm was every moment increasing and even sir william did not look perfectly calm elizabeths courage did not fail her	5.543836661249096
collins had followed him after breakfast and there he would continue nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection but really talking to mr	5.814588684354999
if he does not come to me then said she i shall give him up for ever the gentlemen came and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes but alas	8.587522284418352
it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom	10.399201846019158
sometime hence it will be all found out and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before	5.875762618240891
they have each their advantages and i can be equally happy in either ayethat is because you have the right disposition	6.346099102421092
my mother was in hysterics and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done	8.560225061579537
when tea was over mr	5.775685526404445
but the gloom of lydias prospect was shortly cleared away for she received an invitation from mrs	4.615309816761789
when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother gardiners in town so much in love with her that my sisterinlaw was sure he would make her an offer before we came away	7.775187956721248
let me recommend you however as a friend not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to mr	7.028090503649527
our situation with regard to lady catherines family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast	4.5119159803467195
you will not be fit to be seen when you get there i shall be very fit to see janewhich is all i want is this a hint to me lizzy said her father to send for the horses no indeed	7.7575153215321055
colonel forster will i dare say do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head	7.18033191850326
and what sort of young lady is she	7.658703135076393
young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these but i think i may defy even your sagacity to discover the name of your admirer	6.005811706481898
they will then join his regiment unless they are first invited to longbourn and i understand from mrs	6.219077559259258
it was painful exceedingly painful to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return	7.243006604299404
but i dare not hope it	6.691298583949215
sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity	6.167406102481791
the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions	4.720041212579201
their manners are not equal to his certainly not at first	10.530613024286161
i cannot make him out there is something very pompous in his style and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail we cannot suppose he would help it if he could can he be a sensible man sir no my dear i think not	7.199949878311876
her face is too thin her complexion has no brilliancy and her features are not at all handsome	6.596139421595967
she felt anew the justice of mr	4.450312158816884
darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult to understand	9.577305999938899
bennet cried his wife what are you talking of	6.720777478748182
the promised letter of thanks from mr	4.429263188713639
is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring	8.057033539315912
i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her but i was overruled as i always am	9.191879856472337
jane resolutely kept her place at the table but elizabeth to satisfy her mother went to the windowshe looked she saw mr	7.385300527535117
such very superior dancing is not often seen	8.584009705912239
the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident	6.780833632198948
and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection	8.935130455742444
bennet was likely to live and sir william gave it as his decided opinion that whenever mr	6.0563866556192
while she spoke an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion earnestly looking at her and his sister overcome with confusion and unable to lift up her eyes	5.344640593625422
those who chose to be idle certainly might aye no doubt but that is what a governess will prevent and if i had known your mother i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one	6.008182542304493
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr	7.223783667067861
it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane said she	7.969086097653482
he must be an oddity i think said she	7.824403611815446
darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her	6.2710143681527954
but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence	6.036757122568197
they all paint tables cover skreens and net purses	3.0824971613905445
at that moment she cared for no other	6.41750347670432
their mutual affection will steady them and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly and live in so rational a manner as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten their conduct has been such replied elizabeth as neither you nor i nor any body can ever forget	5.133155156789811
i hate such false friends	4.790153448568158
collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again put it out of her power to dance with others	8.816677002439128
they are not married nor can i find there was any intention of being so but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side i hope it will not be long before they are	8.169459725253288
wickham i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family	7.251789684541618
it is almost past belief	5.632862373151903
hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description when mr	4.966399476811482
he was the proudest most disagreeable man in the world and every body hoped that he would never come there again	7.27203386936548
and on the gentlemens approaching one of the girls moved closer to her than ever and said in a whisper the men shant come and part us i am determined	7.430533664543096
what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here	6.725256089956605
tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantleys will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again at present i have not room to do them justice oh	7.332885427418821
darcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes	7.149941407637568
lady catherines unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts	5.335132609560379
recovering himself however shortly he turned to his partner and said sir williams interruption has made me forget what we were talking of i do not think we were speaking at all	6.532893156562918
but your family owe me nothing	5.402747153616435
it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence a most country town indifference to decorum it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said bingley	5.817369701761838
but the clothes the wedding clothes	5.295451505267783
see paragraph NUM e below	5.646125633204031
it became her turn to listen	6.292757448138351
bennet from fighting	5.249269162800947
bingley and jane however soon allowed the others to outstrip them	4.779000802309623
i wish you had been there my dear to have given him one of your set downs	9.344788753831468
what are men to rocks and mountains	3.9784227360591613
that is all to be forgot	12.85604520192177
she studied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different	5.618259656835711
she grew absolutely ashamed of herself of neither darcy nor wickham could she think without feeling that she had been blind partial prejudiced absurd	4.877836012837895
but so we all do	6.645552376667489
so lizzy said he one day your sister is crossed in love i find	7.2684663415393835
darcys steward and of that i can assure you he informed me himself i beg your pardon replied miss bingley turning away with a sneer	6.755127097746155
he then asked her to walk into the housebut she declared herself not tired and they stood together on the lawn	6.974725436477644
to all the objections i have already urged i have still another to add	7.973740328754306
the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents about a twelvemonth ago was now brought forward again	5.662888806775922
first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion and secondly of my room	9.48757445788119
her ladyship received them civilly but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else and she was in fact almost engrossed by her nephews speaking to them especially to darcy much more than to any other person in the room	7.426010064368456
though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill and if i was her i would not have put up with it	8.818986483842096
i was right therefore my last letter had never reached her	5.8627142134296815
the gentlemen did approach and when mr	5.545777218600856
it does not necessarily follow that a deep intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours lizzy cried her mother remember where you are and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home i did not know before continued bingley immediately that you were a studier of character	6.467847411771035
you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking and thinking for your approbation alone	6.161289716471259
they met again on sunday and then i saw him too	7.989837555833774
it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other womans of superior execution darcy smiled and said you are perfectly right	5.838266997343663
but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good	8.53882437496188
bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication	7.806772736668497
to miss lydia bennet without there being a syllable said of her father or the place where she lived or any thing	8.231283235911452
it is a pity they are not handsome	8.13412771484892
i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband did mrs	8.576081485654555
in the hall they parted	8.347863369639837
elizabeth most thankfully consented and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes	4.99535229253474
no lizzy let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame	8.595742542011031
they were within twenty yards of each other and so abrupt was his appearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight	5.674668356604816
let me mend it for you	6.955693739055772
elizabeth was determined nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion	5.972114508767851
do you often dance at st	5.651025633861847
i am prodigiously proud of him	5.393441527573865
he has more to give	9.668777856992305
darcy it was welcome intelligenceelizabeth had been at netherfield long enough	8.368857437939447
how is half such a sum to be repaid mr	7.485267484571919
the conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard mr	5.951352558755958
but dont imagine it was from any silly cause	7.132603074192085
bennet withdrew to the library she saw mr	6.851083003611143
if i can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too remember eliza that he does not know janes disposition as you do but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal it he must find it out perhaps he must if he sees enough of her	8.07820027305767
but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man whom they had never seen before of most gentlemanlike appearance walking with an officer on the other side of the way	7.288979713362619
had his character been known this could not have happened	6.978080197451466
you wanted me i know to say yes that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt	6.652028030439066
how shall i bear so much happiness she then hastened away to her mother who had purposely broken up the card party and was sitting up stairs with kitty	7.161250973405312
collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeysand i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance mr	6.129360552706637
but however he did not	7.301076195413528
when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford every eye was in search of the parsonage and every turning expected to bring it in view	7.272112104561354
his most particular friend you see by janes account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her	6.364064820965091
after walking several miles in a leisurely manner and too busy to know any thing about it they found at last on examining their watches that it was time to be at home	6.771205373735619
she could neither wonder nor condemn but the belief of his selfconquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom afforded no palliation of her distress	5.666830478256421
in understanding darcy was the superior	9.22150637837302
you must not disappoint your father my dear aunt this is being serious indeed yes and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise well then you need not be under any alarm	6.654701881782101
resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment and i trust i am resigned	7.388231328848683
elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants	9.97377544730518
our distress my dear lizzy is very great	9.055142127242638
they found mary as usual deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to	4.422233766857407
their parties abroad were less varied than before and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle and though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense since the disturbers of her brain were removed her other sister from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp	5.188677627292404
jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be though in a quieter way	9.849629928877532
my father supported him at school and afterwards at cambridgemost important assistance as his own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have been unable to give him a gentlemans education	6.259338378887303
she certainly did not hate him	7.362012645712379
but i will no longer importune my young cousin then turning to mr	4.556090985732909
they met several times for there was much to be discussed	8.507322694423694
which will not be yours till after your mothers decease is all that you may ever be entitled to	7.320478686456656
the coach therefore took them the first stage of their journey and brought its master back to longbourn	5.648340689322603
his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling to be sure lizzy said her aunt he is not so handsome as wickham or rather he has not wickhams countenance for his features are perfectly good	8.161206749230963
her teeth are tolerable but not out of the common way and as for her eyes which have sometimes been called so fine i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them	6.436844595553652
he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place and his intrigues all honoured with the title of seduction had been extended into every tradesmans family	6.244772468860169
to this speech bingley made no answer but his sisters gave it their hearty assent and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friends vulgar relations	5.107959494926401
from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl	7.652166237554006
what a charming amusement for young people this is mr	5.337283859124948
it was mr	6.197959411746536
to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying	5.2842182098236155
your mother must have been quite a slave to your education elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case	8.60382508165401
bennet had been down stairs but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table and in spirits oppressively high	7.888508137658176
he leaves out half his words and blots the rest my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express themby which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents your humility mr	4.313375691860399
elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion	6.459850305103665
were the whole arrangement complete my disappointment would be certain	7.371554536989075
the dejection was almost universal	5.6170385886705985
the sight of miss lucas was odious to her	7.515119443020444
miss de bourgh was pale and sickly her features though not plain were insignificant and she spoke very little except in a low voice to mrs	4.91954708982571
come let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydias folly indeed you are mistaken	6.503394267755633
her favourite walk and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine was along the open grove which edged that side of the park where there was a nice sheltered path which no one seemed to value but herself and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherines curiosity	5.823114653735719
if there were any one that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that it might be of essential consequence	7.971405467418568
gardiner looked at her niece with a smile but elizabeth could not return it	8.399034304240494
girls can i do any thing for you in meryton	12.028872266870476
there is one point on which i want your advice	8.236842831818207
dont think me angry however for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side	7.5232986433339955
she wished she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them and whether she wished or feared it most she could scarcely determine	8.140770061837273
yes do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley	6.403560636930226
the têteàtête surprised them	5.626176947134438
i only want to think you perfect and you set yourself against it	6.3174736607445565
she seems perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends an easy distance do you call it	8.256687527778327
bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able to do something for him and his situation must have been benefited by marriage	9.732065032426117
i have no reason i assure you said he to be dissatisfied with my reception	7.282026599450894
the principal purport of his letter was to inform them that mr	8.301071637039955
i have just had a letter from jane with such dreadful news	7.284453829699743
gardiner and after relating the circumstances she thus went on i am now convinced my dear aunt that i have never been much in love for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion i should at present detest his very name and wish him all manner of evil	5.782692563378165
yes miss bennet interest for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all	8.433161089065655
i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude	5.588482348263957
long has just been here and she told me all about it mr	7.746571531105967
you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each others confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walkingif the first i should be completely in your wayand if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire oh	5.769006582702045
we must trespass a little longer on your kindness removed cried bingley	5.85681541482769
but against this there were objections and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered	7.755868128781861
what do you think	7.7294380239837075
bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them	6.6996323810373335
it is impossible that he should still love me after walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two gentlemen behind on resuming their places after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious waterplant there chanced to be a little alteration	6.058555738399409
having resolved to do it without loss of time as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment he set about it in a very orderly manner with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business	7.513084128987874
lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew but he had never seen any thing but affability in her	5.949344264119508
they were soon gone again rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs	4.724919431165863
they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation and always spending more than they ought	5.572139122270699
the ladies were somewhat more fortunate for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse	4.286504160003604
bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do	5.0043930704897495
i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband unless you looked up to him as a superior	6.70839608880247
they saw him often and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve	7.810875792717864
i am not so selfish however as to press for it if inconvenient	7.4946736033099635
do not imagine me ignorant of their condition whatever my connections may be said elizabeth if your nephew does not object to them they can be nothing to you tell me once for all are you engaged to him though elizabeth would not for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine have answered this question she could not but say after a moments deliberation i am not lady catherine seemed pleased	7.894881984964024
how strange must it appear to him	6.432487157846875
it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match	7.50349235205576
elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene and could observe the three ladies before her composedly lady catherine was a tall large woman with stronglymarked features which might once have been handsome	5.814356586694616
it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland but why all this secrecy	5.9962844622566305
darcy after enquiring of her how mr	7.360196353757325
in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better	6.667461559239779
it is very hard to think that she might have been mr	7.569559199665523
at length every idea seemed to fail him and after standing a few moments without saying a word he suddenly recollected himself and took leave	6.216340441698588
two days after mr	5.712979139244294
the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are on their way to town and without any intention of coming back again	6.962574303772871
but my dear lydia i dont at all like your going such a way off	7.269915126498367
bennet in the meanwhile was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good humour and common politeness of bingley in half an hours visit had revived	6.575988290481616
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule and this cried darcy as he walked with quick steps across the room is your opinion of me	6.713501083612455
they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family	6.012036760586864
haggerston has our directions and all will be completed in a week	7.295555313449656
what congratulations will then flow in	5.278831003558897
i want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than her sisters what you have learnt about mr	7.430130755467994
his understanding and temper though unlike her own would have answered all her wishes	6.962964986632369
i appeal to mr	4.6781894356876235
she could see him instantly before her in every charm of air and address but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess	8.010378609609036
i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy are you indeed	8.187144918109237
darcys indifference and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of his seeing too little she might have fancied too much	7.588916101228564
bingley to her impossible mr	8.091582200975532
it cannot last long	5.814169494177816
the marriage of a daughter which had been the first object of her wishes since jane was sixteen was now on the point of accomplishment and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials fine muslins new carriages and servants	6.753764674673405
i thank you for explaining it so fully	6.166044489457643
gardiners former residence and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained they bent their steps after having seen all the principal wonders of the country and within five miles of lambton elizabeth found from her aunt that pemberley was situated	5.105534091956109
lizzy said he i was going to look for you come into my room she followed him thither and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held	9.072102218103119
it was the second week in may in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurchstreet for the town of in hertfordshire and as they drew near the appointed inn where mr	6.067344726580023
darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingleys designs on him were by his behaviour to his cousin for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself	7.417733300786825
philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence	7.499213625763707
and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more than i ever look into elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room	7.12161849792205
your ladyship wants mr	5.878993037127767
bingley was quite uncomfortable his sisters declared that they were miserable	7.5244700356090695
so genteel and so easy he has always something to say to every body that is my idea of good breeding and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter did charlotte dine with you no she would go home	6.051359070906071
that among his own connections he was esteemed and valuedthat even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling	7.2701406411138905
illustration matlock pride and prejudice a novel	4.053695478740409
he seemed astonished too on finding her alone and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within	6.817200181016084
gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman and required information and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself	6.263470974930508
bennet was doubly engaged on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane who sat some way below her and on the other retailing them all to the younger miss lucases and lydia in a voice rather louder than any other persons was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her	6.628423647612057
philipss house and then made their bows in spite of miss lydias pressing entreaties that they would come in and even in spite of mrs	5.715323317122003
now seriously what have you ever known of selfdenial and dependence	5.039962784119794
such i was from eight to eight and twenty and such i might still have been but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth	6.753217616306754
as for the gentleman himself his feelings were chiefly expressed not by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence	4.712785488925189
every disposition of the ground was good and she looked on the whole scene the river the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley as far as she could trace it with delight	7.727138125711826
gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again	6.141732144325289
whatever he said was said well and whatever he did done gracefully	6.748361859706706
the miss webbs all play and their father has not so good an income as yours do you draw no not at all what none of you not one that is very strange	7.663689111387711
darcys explanation there had appeared very insufficient and she read it again	7.291386504605754
though she dared not depend upon the consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour	6.087312234322672
and of this place thought she i might have been mistress	11.291912416333668
but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible or at least it was impossible not to try for information	7.3322811568560144
they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds	4.851843781643804
hurst called them to order with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward	5.77157273375801
your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct i am sure	7.296965275216929
had she not seen him in derbyshire she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged but she still thought him partial to jane and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friends permission or being bold enough to come without it	8.133586880294326
you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken	5.679405164931966
darcy could be so unworthy of mr	6.320354150352448

while sir william was with them mr	6.232031068321648
to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine and her daughter and on his return brought back with great satisfaction a message from her ladyship importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her	7.51811096352813
it will pass away soon enough do you suppose them to be in london yes where else can they be so well concealed and lydia used to want to go to london added kitty	6.779669605740063
but whether she were violently set against the match or violently delighted with it it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense and she could no more bear that mr	7.948265859232358
collins and myself on this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been advertised by the same authority	7.133824234085367
not lydia only but all were concerned in it and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror mr	6.5358040557248485
i wonder when you would have spoken if i had not asked you	8.18290424930408
you may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire my dear cousin	7.273444125411113
hill and the two housemaids	9.527665094214012
we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect	7.144124928219228
and her neighbours at lucas lodge therefore for through their communication with the collinses the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only set that down as almost certain and immediate which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time	5.151408315033511
you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myselffor i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy elizabeth could not but look surprised	7.10053087028797
painful recollections will intrude which cannot which ought not to be repelled	5.226961387734271
elizabeth thought this was going pretty far and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added i have never had a cross word from him in my life and i have known him ever since he was four years old this was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite to her ideas	8.059017108595453
he was angry	8.545974768944827
lydia came to us and wickham had constant admission to the house	7.9965825727296975
bennet and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy	6.586963717972343
my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking	6.856605875410017
reynolds replied that he was adding but we expect him tomorrow with a large party of friends how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day	6.28482251006137
her heart was divided between concern for her sister and resentment against all the others	6.66585858742038
the next day opened a new scene at longbourn	5.538511692942739
she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind in what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of every thing she was still dear to him	8.093827533955283

she liked him too little to care for his approbation	7.724921293272065
bingley and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as jane	5.3510349518498375
she had never perceived while the regiment was in hertfordshire that lydia had any partiality for him but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body	7.548523009700678
they were to be off as soon as possible	8.173042969248396
i expected you to stay two months	6.515363686523507
bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though he had been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two full courses	9.09402209412357
colonel fitzwilliams occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different which her own knowledge of him could not have told her and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love and the object of that love her friend eliza she sat herself seriously to work to find it out she watched him whenever they were at rosings and whenever he came to hunsford but without much success	7.895179557965167

darcy i am a very selfish creature and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding yours	7.83757776150448

her father had been an attorney in meryton and had left her four thousand pounds	7.07762162915842
wickham when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition	4.508985200707381

younger sons cannot marry where they like unless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often do our habits of expence make us too dependant and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money is this thought elizabeth meant for me and she coloured at the idea but recovering herself said in a lively tone and pray what is the usual price of an earls younger son	5.615726566779423

his friend had left him that morning for london but was to return home in ten days time	6.935278495248087
hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid who continued though slowly to mend and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawingroom	6.698209250744857

bingley cried his wife	7.0898276040501935
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject	5.453756308019942
if he fears me why come hither	4.662592043597614
bennet was told of this she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected considering what her anxiety for his life had been before	8.661471336539837
his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstancesand he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself	8.549852079712933
every thing however went on smoothly and was finally settled according to charlottes first sketch	5.192500916171683

every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented and fixed his eyes upon herself she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before she remembered its warmth and softened its impropriety of expression	7.16954207634293
but of every other neglect i can believe him capable	7.897670082863982
collins was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as mr	8.524914959158988

she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances and she was in no humour to indulge him	8.320608094505426
he must write his own sermons and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible	7.540461808891762
with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart	7.067596081656641
with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs	4.3514679377317576
bennet in short was in very great spirits she had seen enough of bingleys behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at last and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals	8.70736642029615
darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from me	8.432200301774898

i dare say i shall soon see them here elizabeth shook her head over this letter	5.260857215029946

every time they met it was more decided and remarkable	6.950237410055259

vain indeed must be all her attentions vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself if he were already selfdestined to another	7.401836036011443
darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said this walk is not wide enough for our party	5.504270710899384
i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother lady catherine	7.332685830762679
i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness or me either for that matter	6.823744769035087

they are in the same profession you know only in different lines	7.167507908281286
i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you i imagine have been alluding is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe	5.856837217413357
in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingleys in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects for jealousy had not yet made her desperate and her attentions to mr	5.855017618096189
i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after	8.002986007462571
bennet was satisfied and soon afterwards ordered her carriage	6.090359145407403
bennet to whose apartment they all repaired after a few minutes conversation together received them exactly as might be expected with tears and lamentations of regret invectives against the villanous conduct of wickham and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing	4.945839127165763

after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible the former continued the subject by saying but tell me all and every thing about it which i have not already heard	7.2553463591668255

elizabeth went away with her head full of him	10.527911958910456
my dear charlotte impossible the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach though as it was no more than she expected she soon regained her composure and calmly replied why should you be surprised my dear eliza do you think it incredible that mr	4.748817970849269
by many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance but in vain mary would not understand them such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song	6.070504911712645
joness shop boy in the street who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away when her civility was claimed towards mr	6.4787999483510585
for we must attribute this happy conclusion she added in a great measure to his kindness	7.809726052271067
there was no want of discourse	7.489442155295266
it is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world	7.474111756439366
i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter la	6.928398753644634
then who taught you	5.397529263780351
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcys marriage but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley she dropt all her resentment was fonder than ever of georgiana almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth	4.5148660940225644
there is a mixture of servility and selfimportance in his letter which promises well	5.593847266014923
bennet have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again today i advise mr	5.047638496579291
what is to become of us	6.567736688970605
and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton of whom i shall subjoin a list according to his information	5.610838462449067
let her go then	6.32296059211521
she then yawned again threw aside her book and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet she turned suddenly towards him and said by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield i would advise you before you determine on it to consult the wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure if you mean darcy cried her brother he may go to bed if he chuses before it beginsbut as for the ball it is quite a settled thing and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards i should like balls infinitely better she replied if they were carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting	6.388315440488437
though darcy could never receive him at pemberley yet for elizabeths sake he assisted him farther in his profession	5.47364731482971
brotherinlaw of wickham	7.6428574883652844
at present i will say nothing about it you are quite right	8.295577693330607
the possibility of mr	5.930203140447703
elizabeth who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr	5.879154424970638
their reception from mr	4.804603051340497
i do not deserve it	5.94313912232118
but you have chosen your fault well i really cannot laugh at it	6.212372536942504
elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied	5.7459025307256
darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers she had formed no expectation at all of its contents	8.955052520027545
your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable if it be so if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable	7.251780049236148
she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her and though by no means so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers he might become a very agreeable companion	6.46755819753306
his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party and he bore with the illjudged officiousness of the mother and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter	7.049684258116257
bennet and we shall very soon settle it with her i am sure she would not give him time to reply but hurrying instantly to her husband called out as she entered the library oh	7.979623437571372
i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference	7.301630872662932
its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned	3.5973643863907325
by all that i have ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of selfcomplacency on the score of some quality or other real or imaginary	6.59198563311623
wretched wretched mistake darcy made no answer	4.355699198560079
each felt for the other and of course for themselves and their mother talked on of her dislike of mr	9.194202039789428
well colonel fitzwilliam what do i play next	6.482440866103751
after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room from the sideboard to the fender to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london mr	7.952214450657646
creating the works from public domain print editions means that no one owns a united states copyright in these works so the foundation and you can copy and distribute it in the united states without permission and without paying copyright royalties	4.7483800600141235
howsoever that may be you are grievously to be pitied in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs	8.555273338323133
you are joking lizzy	5.827127667093901
from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents your mother will never see you again if you do not marry mr	7.929950391603457
the officers of the shire were in general a very creditable gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party but mr	9.322564578292148
while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind she was all surpriseall astonishment that wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible	6.506302240202603
even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr	5.587011097448767
in the gallery there were many family portraits but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger	7.1519582320569945
oh said she i heard you before but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply	9.80316457653466
darcy i am sure said miss bingley and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition certainly not to walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it is above her ancles in dirt and alone quite alone	6.781695416546929
in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room	7.827242183318362
on this point she was soon satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted a recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared	5.985202989458519
she was received however very politely by them and in their brothers manners there was something better than politeness there was good humour and kindness mr	6.977894841180825
while thus engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr	5.7114207710922855
this was very amiable but charlottes kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception ofits object was nothing less than to secure her from any return of mr	5.64434841731951
bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr	6.631026051716813
darcy in a most infamous manner	7.924261716381152
bennet who was most anxious to get rid of him and have his library to himself for thither mr	6.942062962806782
she told the story however with great spirit among her friends for she had a lively playful disposition which delighted in any thing ridiculous	6.46774895657744
elizabeth was excessively disappointed she had set her heart on seeing the lakes and still thought there might have been time enough	6.2460305682838175
his temptation is not adequate to the risk do you really think so cried elizabeth brightening up for a moment	7.308798895783014
the officers may not be so pleasant in general s regiment his daughters request for such it might be considered of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the north received at first an absolute negative	6.955286644256179
well my dear said he when she ceased speaking i have no more to say	8.707111507109808
to no creature had it been revealed where secresy was possible except to elizabeth and from all bingleys connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming hereafter her own	6.184762585684403
that he should have been in love with her for so many months	9.312973052266624
about a month said elizabeth and then unwilling to let the subject drop added he is a man of very large property in derbyshire i understand yes replied wickham his estate there is a noble one	7.251014102525168
darcy i talked about the dance and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples he smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said	8.140803100346254
bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humour reserve and caprice that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character	5.153748867607627
his fear of her has always operated i know when they were together and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh which i am certain he has very much at heart elizabeth could not repress a smile at this but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head	8.670262581525426
he is just what a young man ought to be said she sensible good humoured lively and i never saw such happy manners so much ease with such perfect good breeding he is also handsome replied elizabeth which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can	7.9252570786521215
jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she were indisposed	4.612974438639349
collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family in your present distress which must be of the bitterest kind because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove	5.868561262659923
i cannot acquit him of that duty nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family and with a bow to mr	6.717433636292383
very welland this offer of marriage you have refused i have sir very well	6.33341095973993
i shall be back by dinner i admire the activity of your benevolence observed mary but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason and in my opinion exertion should always be in proportion to what is required we will go as far as meryton with you said catherine and lydia elizabeth accepted their company and the three young ladies set off together	6.093370011827401
their powers of conversation were considerable	5.113206279129586
i am only resolved to act in that manner which will in my own opinion constitute my happiness without reference to you or to any person so wholly unconnected with me it is well	7.147589623775221
upon the whole i am much pleased with him as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr	8.693354181784358
i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes	5.562069680273628
i expected to find a more reasonable young woman	7.610801207322887
but on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away	7.382175840509422
my dearest child she cried i can think of nothing else	7.404221476410661
yes i call it a very easy distance i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match cried elizabeth	8.258303996134096
is miss darcy much grown since the spring said miss bingley will she be as tall as i am i think she will	8.37427058698436
collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless	5.020566052745789
you have sense and we all expect you to use it	7.96779996850547
any place would do of about three or four hundred a year but however do not speak to mr	5.691520876721043
i send no compliments to your mother	6.682833231079638
elizabeth however had never been blind to the impropriety of her fathers behaviour as a husband	9.71931971461266
it was over at last however	8.193769710580574
on the evening before my going to london said he i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago	8.176670513680564
it would be nothing i could see him with perfect indifference but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of	7.056296620067626
as a clergyman moreover i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of goodwill are highly commendable and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch	5.131766258001892
of course we hope that you will support the project gutenbergtm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing project gutenbergtm works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the project gutenbergtm name associated with the work	5.611432228769367
change of scene might be of serviceand perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt persuaded of her sisters ready acquiescence	6.55047402309461
what is he coming home and without poor lydia she cried	6.82750410129206
elizabeth would not observe her and when at last kitty did she very innocently said what is the matter mamma	7.85720736293401
i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body	5.9355446898755195
next time you call said she i hope we shall be more lucky he should be particularly happy at any time c	6.385375796665638
the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his handwriting or on the evenness of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each	7.19415045361799
she comes to us today	7.790332559689924
she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied from the reason of things that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his and she would have wondered why without violently caring for her he chose to elope with her at all had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances and if that were the case he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion	7.869187399664776
forster called her and they were going to the campand from her correspondence with her sister there was still less to be learntfor her letters to kitty though rather longer were much too full of lines under the words to be made public	8.028581788997151
bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn	6.866533863543464
nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my soninlaw	6.431429159893246
darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour till sir william thus began	6.961636490960389
if i could but see you as happy	10.183133018740293
there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters mr	5.641519108574771
the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself and the kindness of the late mr	10.172015824943989
but the wife of mr	5.0252078188597125
my dear friend if you are not so compassionate as to dine today with louisa and me we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives for a whole days têteàtête between two women can never end without a quarrel	6.25737900324632
i never heard any thing so abominable	6.5275371313326245
he was quite young wonderfully handsome extremely agreeable and to crown the whole he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party	7.1402307497888655
bingley who seems good humour itself and is i really believe truly amiable be in friendship with such a man	6.246432511890059
he was then he said on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her	8.619608287464224
it is nearly fifty miles and what is fifty miles of good road	6.01242420859992
in short my dear aunt i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy but since we see every day that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist	6.391694006719924
i told him moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend	7.613614967724435
noit is not for me to be driven away by mr	8.183133600618728
the general prejudice against mr	5.683344742113082
by nature inoffensive friendly and obliging his presentation at st	3.516687629227577
but is it certain absolutely certain oh yes they left brighton together on sunday night and were traced almost to london but not beyond they are certainly not gone to scotland and what has been done what has been attempted to recover her my father is gone to london and jane has written to beg my uncles immediate assistance and we shall be off i hope in half an hour	5.821182692409096
bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn and addressed herself particularly to mr	5.900303640948511
no aunt no officers no news could be sought afterthe very shoeroses for netherfield were got by proxy	3.4007439774458326
they have not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression	7.6296292822493355
at first there seemed danger of lydias engrossing him entirely for she was a most determined talker but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets she soon grew too much interested in the game too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for any one in particular	5.535173728676725
the others then joined her and expressed their admiration of his figure but elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own feelings followed them in silence	7.249876125343707
at last she recollected that she had been travelling and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance	6.295737004805018
in town i believe he chiefly lived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation	5.390551910517478
he is not at all liked in hertfordshire	8.122067837770018
it was to this effect since writing the above dearest lizzy something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature but i am afraid of alarming yoube assured that we are all well	5.121185177540624
bingleys name had been last mentioned between them and if she might judge from his complexion his mind was not very differently engaged	8.062167315637343
bennet accompanied by her two youngest girls reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast	6.85134925193508
his debts to be discharged and something still to remain	6.091652441229884
bingley his two sisters the husband of the eldest and another young man	6.9455184711108275
towards him i have been kinder than towards myself elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection but its meaning did not escape nor was it likely to conciliate her	4.692829547741918
nonsense how can you talk so	6.48854730913571
the advice was followed readily for the feverish symptoms increased and her head ached acutely	5.591253796387991
observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat he suddenly addressed her with i hope mr	4.808524273602234
here leading the way through every walk and cross walk and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind	4.0376968204356505
bennet and therefore instead of making any answer she went on as before i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate	9.04652259011063
now what have you to say only this that if he is so you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me lady catherine hesitated for a moment and then replied the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind	9.260218515548791
i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear for heavens sake madam speak lower what advantage can it be to you to offend mr	6.180765819753251
she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage and had a few minutes conversation with charlotte but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out	7.132521827725631
the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance	7.016989260799354
gardiner and her niece however did her justice and pitied her	5.8760453810559925
wickham has deserved much less attention from mr	4.487593795122798
in the diningroom they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before	6.893625172546979
but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable	6.047548076956333
darcy she then sought her eldest sister who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley	8.282807916600369
collins should be able to procure any womans good opinion because he was not so happy as to succeed with you but elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort for it was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished her all imaginable happiness	8.221113754893363
collins was gratified and with a more smiling solemnity replied it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably	6.52458044097392
elizabeths impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned and preparing her to be surprised she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr	6.522169820823991
she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt who did call on him in her return through london and there relate her journey to longbourn its motive and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which in her ladyships apprehension peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give	6.880113294907662
his debts are to be paid amounting i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her and his commission purchased	6.756490780025429
he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention	6.841686546327924
younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement	6.4853133747361325
he stood by her however for some minutes in silence and at last on the young ladys whispering to elizabeth again he walked away	8.38514987519611
elizabeths eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute began another	6.4243127168110865
and do you really love him quite well enough	8.572476427862778
gardiner were engaged with their children was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party	6.9905981655158635
bingleys regard and yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to interest all her tender feelings and nothing therefore remained to be done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained	6.319389538837306
as her successor in that house she regarded her with jealous abhorrence	5.253537224862489
by supposing such an affection you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong and me most unhappy	5.323277435348101
darcy who sat opposite to them	6.065898140183513
her keenest attention was awakened she longed to hear more and was grateful to her uncle for saying there are very few people of whom so much can be said	7.438788654238589
he has children of his own and may have more	8.52945823677422
as for elizabeth herself this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia that she considered it as the deathwarrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter and detestable as such a step must make her were it known she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go	8.37487518998092

when she remembered the style of his address she was still full of indignation but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him her anger was turned against herself and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion	5.837321818251687

his anxiety for jane was evident and his attentions to herself most pleasing and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others	8.556043015914495
bingleys sincerity said elizabeth warmly but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only	5.72099766367116

the sanguine hope of good however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her she still expected that it would all end well and that every morning would bring some letter either from lydia or her father to explain their proceedings and perhaps announce the marriage	5.92156882950551
on this subject what can you have to say	9.997422159615606

the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversationa readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably when the sound of horses drew their notice and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street	4.7386922445978295

i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn she burst into tears as she alluded to it and for a few minutes could not speak another word	6.445459056770956
it was dated from rosings at eight oclock in the morning and was as follows be not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you	5.574056140969431

he readily agreed to it	6.613322559838103
at five oclock the two ladies retired to dress and at half past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner	4.995689878059816
i will leave him to himself in spite of what her sister declared and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it	9.209304729894008
they could have been understood only by her mother who might have felt nearly the same	9.083710449238353
darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for himself you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine but which i have never acknowledged	4.988461826705833

bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london and promised to write again very soon	5.736719180016541
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room its aspect and its furniture he addressed himself particularly to her as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him	7.137946862218268

you will not i hope consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family my dear madam by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughters favour without having paid yourself and mr	4.870387684956222
she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together	6.510692361298826
shocking cried miss bingley	6.958923950414135
about ten or a dozen years ago before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire to which he belonged	7.077986863381372
the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point upon my word well that was very decided indeedthat does seem as ifbut however it may all come to nothing you know my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours eliza said charlotte	5.5431696692006325
he scarcely ever spoke to her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all and especially to her friend	8.753439317121309
the horses were post and neither the carriage nor the livery of the servant who preceded it were familiar to them	5.2001986344464335
and there are several of the young men too that she likes very much	8.744603183414599
were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago every thing she was persuaded would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion	7.343079632506554
she had ventured only one glance at darcy	5.753798029178302
his apparent partiality had subsided his attentions were over he was the admirer of some one else	5.433438789003617
if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very thankful and then you may say whatever you like of me what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side and mr	8.234832923487291
collins and i will never see you again if you do elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning but mrs	7.6931463588254765
kitty and me were to spend the day there and mrs	7.118651883757629
as for elizabeth her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out	7.373072566964799
i would keep a pack of foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine every day then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said mrs	4.627057630516115
he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before wished his fair cousins health and happiness again and promised their father another letter of thanks	5.817416180255916
believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections	5.742265037256671
miss bingleys civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly as well as her affection for jane and when they parted after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield and embracing her most tenderly she even shook hands with the former elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits	7.624640769185057
gardiner i begin to be of your uncles opinion	8.510427548335874
why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight	6.552988964022896
on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls whose eagerness for their cousins appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawingroom and whose shyness as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth prevented their coming lower	5.94270521171377
i must conclude for i cannot be long from my poor mother	8.375741255788506
and so you like this mans sisters too do you	5.812213843736173
i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought nor their offences against myself	4.641260722687224
yes maam that he was indeed and his son will be just like himjust as affable to the poor elizabeth listened wondered doubted and was impatient for more	7.220236146240972
whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject	5.706764483245214
darcy looked up	7.152211798099465
collinss character connections and situation in life i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly and after an awkward pause they returned to the rest of the family	5.443008804193737
such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences she frequently sent them	7.422585504244422
in three volumes	4.896002348037563
his affection for her soon sunk into indifference hers lasted a little longer and in spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her	6.309621404813185
if she is half as sharp as her mother she is saving enough	8.296588355244216
we must not make him desperate the tumult of elizabeths mind was allayed by this conversation	5.252527171837441
in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother though expressed most concisely he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him	6.12464502487127
the next morning however made an alteration for in a quarter of an hours têteàtête with mrs	5.249403669396376
lydia my love ring the bell	5.667158521084614
in consequence of an agreement between the sisters elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day	9.10856525206612
he is so excessively handsome	6.552691554604095
their sisters wedding day arrived and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself	8.373777577423425
teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind	4.689225314364007
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again having still a great deal to say to her and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends	7.7224709652390136
she talked to elizabeth again and again coaxed and threatened her by turns	5.052099451347302
darcy the latter of whom however could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her in spite of all miss bingleys witticisms on fine eyes	6.923153069250235
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it better that one only of the household and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject	6.978898480252522
but on second thoughts perhaps lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other person elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved	6.27971835513234
that abominable mr	5.454072309300355
he came to tell mr	7.474838842555643
jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day	8.104815114713393
it would have suited me in every respect how should you have liked making sermons exceedingly well	5.686861964172651
at present i will not say more but perhaps when we are better acquainted he was interrupted by a summons to dinner and the girls smiled on each other	7.741057815007591
the children have been wanting me this half hour	5.872579917600553
when they were all in the drawingroom the questions which elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give	8.730193265445957
i cannot misunderstand you but i intreat you dear lizzy not to pain me by thinking that person to blame and saying your opinion of him is sunk	6.048300341278869
they could talk of nothing but officers and mr	6.71575735357787
good heaven	6.213152422774563
it must not be thought of	10.915928448643962
as she went up stairs to get ready mrs	7.149688262008879
many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of lydias connections which is not likely can i suppose her so lost to every thing impossible	7.155216010672632
it is impossible for me to be impartial	8.787295698908254
who could have done less for her	8.866972244749688
he was received by mrs	6.325320870826043
mary and kitty were both with mrs	5.482345367946711
dear yesbut you must own she is very plain	8.36862003544029
we had better go into the avenue but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them laughingly answered no no stay where you are you are charmingly groupd and appear to uncommon advantage	6.280693302860603
charlotte the wife of mr	4.652899530311348
collins you have been a daily witness of and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunatebut on this point it will be as well to be silent	6.356914648022661
darcy as well as elizabeth really loved them and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing her into derbyshire had been the means of uniting them	6.3324220761063605
calling back the servant therefore she commissioned him though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible to fetch his master and mistress home instantly	4.214283406541723
bennet and kitty though she was perfectly unknown to them even inferior to what elizabeth felt	8.491622176600389
i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do mr	6.55894269334092
miss bingley offered her the carriage and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it when jane testified such concern in parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present	7.137757272739486
susceptibility to her feelings which are naturally lively enough	7.348118338434779
we live in so different a part of town all our connections are so different and as you well know we go out so little that it is very improbable they should meet at all unless he really comes to see her and that is quite impossible for he is now in the custody of his friend and mr	7.368417432269479
she related the subject of the pictures the dimensions of the rooms and the price of the furniture in vain	9.007453073468486
did she call to refuse her consent to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh and as it had been asked without the least suspicion she was not distressed by his repeating it	7.482460288654344
darcys regard mr	5.6145542120312255
bennet found with amazement and horror that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter	5.417024996645064
she turned from sister to sister demanding their congratulations and when at length they all sat down looked eagerly round the room took notice of some little alteration in it and observed with a laugh that it was a great while since she had been there	6.5331845429357625
darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and as far as their acquaintance reached there was no fault to find	8.873808339643624
the housekeeper came forward and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman the son of her late masters steward who had been brought up by him at his own expence he is now gone into the army she added but i am afraid he has turned out very wild mrs	7.048476838835213
every thing nourishes what is strong already	6.46245073140287
but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london	8.243098537235538
her reflections were in general satisfactory	7.710362496647402
with a renewal of tenderness however they repaired to her room on leaving the diningparlour and sat with her till summoned to coffee	6.082137335246946
her aunt now called her to look at a picture	9.906439270525288
if there were but such another man for you if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as you	8.481062374021624
they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses and what is to divide them	6.029091348749246
widely different was the effect of a second perusal how could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance which she had been obliged to give in the other he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sisters attachmentand she could not help remembering what charlottes opinion had always been neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane she felt that janes feelings though fervent were little displayed and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility	6.682146360479469
if his own vanity however did not mislead him he was the cause his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered and still continued to suffer	8.184143654660263
collins did i tell you of lady metcalfes calling yesterday to thank me	5.209008605002717
with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted	6.877191166100777

it soothed but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus selfattracted by the rest of her familyand as she considered that janes disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before	6.841010780381423
darcy my fathers opinion of me does me the greatest honour and i should be miserable to forfeit it	6.797614287740469
if such goodness does not make her miserable now she will never deserve to be happy	8.430238384927824
there is something a little stately in him to be sure replied her aunt but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming	9.429071942939636
of his former way of life nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself	8.762718191076683
her hair so untidy so blowsy yes and her petticoat i hope you saw her petticoat six inches deep in mud i am absolutely certain and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office your picture may be very exact louisa said bingley but this was all lost upon me	5.643991726273984
no noi feel he may defy us there	5.513075573116462
jane looked well and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them	7.211724559541866
hear me in silence	9.09392866065247
every body said how well she looked and mr	5.998681764782826
bingley was by no means deficient but darcy was clever	5.6446391006886865
when they parted lady catherine with great condescension wished them a good journey and invited them to come to hunsford again next year and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both	5.679276700147733
collins thus addressed her when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character really mr	7.482007560206604
darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of affection to myself how strange cried elizabeth	7.616797982161191
darcy you see is the man	9.313645472289755
but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties by all means cried bingley let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of	6.129584490456041
bennet whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters	6.7550345789181705
hurst reminded his sisterinlaw of the cardtablebut in vain	5.579839815381213
five daughters successively entered the world but yet the son was to come and mrs	7.005350213829666
bennet made no answer	5.022999671426703
she retreated from the window fearful of being seen and as she walked up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made every thing worse	6.3734767022450285
elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation	4.459075347549845
they are young in the ways of the world and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain chapter iv	7.6979680478900345
my fingers wait your orders perhaps said darcy i should have judged better had i sought an introduction but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers shall we ask your cousin the reason of this said elizabeth still addressing colonel fitzwilliam	5.121513015000725
indeed jane you ought to believe me no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection	6.771254685766596
i have sent for you on an affair of importance	6.6462856583566845
such doings discomposed mr	4.440566708212993
yes always she replied without knowing what she said for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming i remember hearing you once say mr	6.420049453187939
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings and mrs	7.9040583788284415
now was the moment for her resolution to be executed and while her courage was high she immediately said mr	6.9679252157542475
what could she mean by it	7.250343938124533
you are all to come to pemberley at christmas	7.4090783336332136
never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her	7.077968794521212
bingley will dance with you at the next ball oh said lydia stoutly i am not afraid for though i am the youngest im the tallest the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr	5.971932960212267
but we are all liable to error	6.286599276463562
information about the mission of project gutenbergtm project gutenbergtm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete old middleaged and new computers	4.102135254496279
he is indeedbut considering the inducement my dear miss eliza we cannot wonder at his complaisance for who would object to such a partner elizabeth looked archly and turned away	5.590473997265961
the next was in these words	8.882324192120963
collins then returned to elizabeth	7.739432504991277
but you are always giving her the preference they have none of them much to recommend them replied he they are all silly and ignorant like other girls but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters mr	5.9341550480298615
he did look at it and into it for half an hour was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms satisfied with what the owner said in its praise and took it immediately	8.563207796081082
she assured him that no one intended to play and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her	9.32799845893059
is not it so mrs	8.776740372042823
good heaven	6.213152422774563
do not charge a fee for access to viewing displaying performing copying or distributing any project gutenbergtm works unless you comply with paragraph NUM e NUM or NUM e NUM	3.8172476944170337
he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to any one should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brotherinlaw and he was determined if possible to find out the extent of his assistance and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could	8.363267206122194
it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong he had liberality and he had the means of exercising it and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned	7.7556077135831725
he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem	7.76560125511959
darcy only for a few minutes to take leave but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour hoping for her return and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him she really rejoiced at it	7.1662084066032286
collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary	5.475912735195709
on both sides it was only assertion	8.116483628566666
i know my own strength and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming	9.109465446842886
darcy she moved again towards the gate	5.651844187116741
collins after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will and should never resent her behaviour as any affront seated himself at another table with mr	4.264646956277237
from the farther disadvantage of lydias society she was of course carefully kept and though mrs	6.5445890518607674
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation and her intreaty that she would not give into it	6.628746862738881
but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought and think only of what will make me happy your affection and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt	6.790559694637113
but i hope you will not mind it it is all for janes sake you know and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then	7.893401993202165
i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude or allow her to hear it from any one but myself	7.58185173964084
to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement	6.969987799166125
lydia laughed and said aye that is just like your formality and discretion	5.907503375748546
he begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother but was too angry with lydia to send any message to her	7.401340085729245
but tell me what did you come down to netherfield for	8.649454443682455
how could i ever think her like her nephew said she as she looked in her face	8.962791185812575
if indeed it should be so	8.421226525185308
the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know was at a balland at this ball what do you think he did	7.883692261510967
but i suppose you had no opportunity	9.11035568379734
a single man of large fortune four or five thousand a year	4.944232017897036
where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil	5.314947730304541
in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man	5.093728753780303
wickham is by no means a respectable young man	5.8495260809809695
i believe i have now told you every thing	8.103944324572378
collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt that all her friends dislike would vanish if she could suppose him to be in her power	7.226696936417411
he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her but does lydia know nothing of this	7.73689978553428
they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn the village where they lived and of which they were the principal inhabitants	7.849671098265041
collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter	6.027425375185515
he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i particularly begged him to do	7.213633302415391
how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you he then told her of georgianas delight in her acquaintance and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend	6.621799003902815
gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends	8.183350439612683
bennet scarcely spoke at all but when the servants were withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness	7.711036362643112
sir william lucas and his daughter maria a good humoured girl but as emptyheaded as himself had nothing to say that could be worth hearing and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise	6.677074677284065
the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt	9.657209115210579
i am so grieved for him	5.402413633116825
i know not what to think	6.685899387915554
you want to tell me and i have no objection to hearing it this was invitation enough	7.673415445424293
she knew not how to support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour	5.50108901061987
he who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection she now saw the object of open pleasantry	4.939288531866615
my dear cried his wife i cannot bear to hear that mentioned	6.501329362144991
nobody can tell what i suffer but it is always so	9.8212862013219
what hours of transport we shall spend	6.121523355555314
if i had been able said she to carry my point of going to brighton with all my family this would not have happened but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her	7.3740054063709275
bingley it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me	8.19866482708254
it is not quite a week since they left brighton	6.925605795163221
these are conditions which considering every thing i had no hesitation in complying with as far as i thought myself privileged for you	6.737736633437622
she had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approach received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome	6.4360543042165075
she is now about miss elizabeth bennets height or rather taller how i long to see her again	4.885175409985781
two inferences however were plainly deduced from the whole one that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief and the other that she herself had been barbarously used by them all and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day	7.425956435961684
how despicably have i acted she cried i who have prided myself on my discernment i who have valued myself on my abilities	5.028951017785498
if any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law	4.96778243235556
a clear ten thousand per annum	4.679065717451658
within doors there was lady catherine books and a billiard table but gentlemen cannot be always within doors and in the nearness of the parsonage or the pleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day	7.807425526857025
though i thought it would be very good fun if i was her father lifted up his eyes	9.297358034548992
but my feelings are not only cordial towards him they are even impartial towards miss king	6.031277031234493
he then handed her in maria followed and the door was on the point of being closed when he suddenly reminded them with some consternation that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings	7.327514320955869
bennet was not so well pleased with it	8.712538670933329
when this information was given and they had all taken their seats mr	5.944456891709369
darcy he concluded his speech which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room many stared many smiled but no one looked more amused than mr	5.61846256033995
i wonder what he can be doing there perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh said elizabeth	6.5295126920177875
gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind	7.636862302462503
it originated in mrs	4.998322151310624
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness and with these words he hastily left the room and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house	7.114972801791518
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him	5.069274275237579
bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned instantly to jane leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr	9.48397945052785
and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the north	9.435632799267124
they both set off and the conjectures of the remaining three continued though with little satisfaction till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered	6.970699170289422
and that made the men suspect something and then they soon found out what was the matter with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did lydia assisted by kittys hints and additions endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn	5.809107721342176
i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very welland indeed so i do still at my heart and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a year should want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir williams in his regimentals mama cried lydia my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watsons as they did when they first came she sees them now very often standing in clarkes library mrs	5.492414819473914
darcy to marry your daughter but would my giving you the wishedfor promise make their marriage at all more probable	6.021587017497923
you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous	4.589805142570611
it was an encouragement of vice and had i been the rector of longbourn i should very strenuously have opposed it	5.340663127827357
his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes but his eagerness to grasp at any thing	6.045789592659477
she complained bitterly of all this to her husband	8.322770111980365

when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace when she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage the difference the change was so great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible	5.596999567438091
he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance but that is all	9.516627867905182
it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife	8.577112843814602
do you not know that such a report is spread abroad i never heard that it was and can you likewise declare that there is no foundation for it i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship	7.254648277253408
it has often led him to be liberal and generous to give his money freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve the poor	4.49747708773184
bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourselfand yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else nay cried bingley this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning	6.489517526130861
the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt	11.591819875671067
but i think mr	6.856179226395187
that he should even speak to her was amazing but to speak with such civility to enquire after her family	8.04265737383536
collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig and shewing him the country but when he went away the whole family returned to their usual employments and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing and looking out of window in his own book room which fronted the road	7.088271459828355
their reception at home was most kind	7.772078872602275
it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast for she was in no cheerful humour	7.8316973303153
the project gutenberg literary archive foundation the foundation or pglaf owns a compilation copyright in the collection of project gutenbergtm electronic works	3.7541422006897367
wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friendswhether he may be equally capable of retaining them is less certain he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied elizabeth with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life darcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject	6.3901199286178745
how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton	8.618588669113347
sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance	7.313402879652091
she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence mr	5.714209205326637
now said she that this first meeting is over i feel perfectly easy	5.871616025110288
and there was my aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon	8.188745534137366
in every view it is unaccountable my dear lizzy do not give way to such feelings as these	8.582025273321156
she represented to him all the improprieties of lydias general behaviour the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs	7.142722142758665
who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him his misfortunes repeated darcy contemptuously yes his misfortunes have been great indeed and of your infliction cried elizabeth with energy	5.63834272505327
the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time and the plan became perfect as plan could be	6.678049546506429
i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me but if the same circumstances were to happen again i am sure i should be deceived again	7.705188636876653
this room was my late masters favourite room and these miniatures are just as they used to be then	6.514783246585908
i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you lizzy elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible	7.8135314619013805
did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance when you were in kent i have heard from authority which i thought as good that it was left you conditionally only and at the will of the present patron you have	8.415818422921063
but do not be cast down	7.440189039572077
perhaps he thought her too young	7.811176670592211
lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my fathers behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with tears in her eyes that a sisters sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt	8.0894082197208
but it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes i see no occasion for that	8.684351001784771
darcy is probably notbut mr	3.9677334404871356
when is your next ball to be lizzy tomorrow fortnight aye so it is cried her mother and mrs	6.913681431319617
collins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often told her to come to rosings every day and play on the pianoforte in mrs	7.955359102097719
i do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone and his spirits so greatly discomposed that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this chapter vi	7.946953024270057
he smiled looked handsome and said many pretty things	5.70623652209871
wickham began the subject himself	8.586471946147984
she did not choose it said her daughter she would go she is a very finelooking woman	9.20979905843544
she directly replied you need not be frightened	6.269708753239705
letters of business too	6.089740148698556
it was as follows my dear sir i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation in life to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire	6.122108098821382
a lively imagination soon settled it all	6.135195859023533
there was now employment for the whole party for though they could not all talk they could all eat and the beautiful pyramids of grapes nectarines and peaches soon collected them round the table	5.633041397814792
bennet having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase than she entered the breakfastroom and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection	5.735354826240063
he was well but so much engaged with mr	8.055684819551846
when you told mrs	6.027618310236382
bingleys large fortune the mention of which gave animation to their mother was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign	6.315144829462116
a fortnights acquaintance is certainly very little	5.890348560356982
the room in which the ladies sat was backwards	8.380694119666826
she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent hopeless of seeing him before	4.843821123943063
bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family	6.862390067726833
how nicely we are crammed in cried lydia	4.774202634171115
jane will be quite an old maid soon i declare	6.132154073691818
on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks	5.711694158118901
bennet spent the morning together as had been agreed on	7.517289050171637
they walked on without knowing in what direction	6.46200355738282
he bore it however with admirable calmness	4.979510581305384
i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration	4.999198236224575
for gods sake say no more of his partners	7.1739882185743395
bingley will not be detained in london by them caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter	6.023377679673463
or had you intended any more serious consequence my real purpose was to see you and to judge if i could whether i might ever hope to make you love me	8.035794752676649
at night she opened her heart to jane	7.312306589671058
putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile she said i did not know before that you ever walked this way i have been making the tour of the park he replied as i generally do every year and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage	7.345299551298601
i will go to meryton said she as soon as i am dressed and tell the good good news to my sister philips	7.737908968473387
jenkinson who lives with them	5.51061193816569
the insipidity and yet the noise the nothingness and yet the selfimportance of all these people what would i give to hear your strictures on them your conjecture is totally wrong i assure you	4.235210401774117
there were some very strong objections against the lady were colonel fitzwilliams words and these strong objections probably were her having one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was in business in london	5.291891294253945
wickham passed all his youth there you know elizabeth was distressed	7.270568774277216
i am so happy	6.571324496275065
my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me i shall not say that you are mistaken he replied because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said to colonel fitzwilliam your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say	7.415864127902041
for herself she was humbled but she was proud of him	9.543029243510084
collins with a formal wave of the hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time	6.038904646249306
kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas for mr	5.544917721247372
very few days passed in which mr	7.494711462996612
why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case in the first place replied mr	8.330780450520265
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friends marrying her sister and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case was almost incredible	8.497603571096077
there he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself	13.791697142503061
he certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that look was disputable	7.390276556569701
but in spite of all this fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair	7.2913912618803245
jane looked a little paler than usual but more sedate than elizabeth had expected	5.2266843397099905
the first week of their return was soon gone	8.439198261025648
all that is known after this is that they were seen to continue the london road	8.480469325623718
a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago	6.116771167163125
they gradually ascended for half a mile and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence where the wood ceased and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house situated on the opposite side of a valley into which the road with some abruptness wound	5.717174914645401
those who do not complain are never pitied her daughters listened in silence to this effusion sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation	4.626894627916183
the gardiners staid a week at longbourn and what with the philipses the lucases and the officers there was not a day without its engagement	8.435772116510345
when convinced on that article miss bennet had nothing farther to wish	7.643943855247481
elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourghthe former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time	7.369544127101045
in confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected without actually naming her authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on	6.5708792346310245
on the strength of darcys regard bingley had the firmest reliance and of his judgment the highest opinion	7.0186971643297005
many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter i wish i could hear that you my dearest friend had any intention of making one in the croud but of that i despair	8.746971339244727
collinss side and as many bows on sir williams they departed	5.516409284463423
how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner	8.273089647759512
but slyness seems the fashion	4.379993487776865
i have therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at alland now despise me if you dare indeed i do not dare elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her	6.286919887625259
my mother means well but she does not know no one can know how much i suffer from what she says	8.213203354561365
bennet as she stood at a window the next morning if that disagreeable mr	6.720004988179521
forster the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me	6.0630794450072445
you blamed me for coming no indeed i felt nothing but surprise your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you	5.878746322626153
i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them i am not now to learn replied mr	7.797187818933373
i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly i can readily believe answered he gravely that report may vary greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunity i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied	5.79128431990468
had not my own feelings decided against you had they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister as she pronounced these words mr	6.4266398712467145
yes yes	8.635088864972063
i grieve to find however that colonel f	6.698349253251427
other schemes too came into her head	5.501163033366594
i must have employment and society	5.554796039039115
darcy was one of the best men that ever breathed and the truest friend i ever had and i can never be in company with this mr	8.09862710324142
pray how violent was mr	4.362372983480939
elizabeths mind was too full for conversation but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view	5.665117577165686
the others have been gone on to scarborough these three weeks she could think of nothing more to say but if he wished to converse with her he might have better success	8.258023114226862
as they passed through the hall lady catherine opened the doors into the diningparlour and drawingroom and pronouncing them after a short survey to be decent looking rooms walked on	5.572651937750215
darcy might have liked such an address he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer	5.434386156789976
is nothing due to me on that score	10.419387329141271
there was another reason too for her opposition	7.731889019331912
gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off	6.762729040171157
there could not exist in the world two men over whom mr	6.572486905144666
gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july and must be in london again within a month and as that left too short a period for them to go so far and see so much as they had proposed or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on they were obliged to give up the lakes and substitute a more contracted tour and according to the present plan were to go no farther northward than derbyshire	6.355539438727695
my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughters lips instead of your own	4.963465834220103
poor dear child	6.747042181424537
their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike manhe is a great friend of darcys oh	7.045027189724868
have all her friends left her mrs	7.904783323298536
this is a parade cried he which does one good it gives such an elegance to misfortune	5.128893636207079
young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage and if she has the true darcy spirit she may like to have her own way as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth	7.044745418268927
darcy elizabeth coloured and said a little and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman maam yes very handsome i am sure i know none so handsome but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer larger picture of him than this	7.415450151880143
his brotherinlaw mr	5.809461198404927
she tried to recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence that might rescue him from the attacks of mr	3.479953997807498
but not long was the interval of tranquillity for when supper was over singing was talked of and she had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty preparing to oblige the company	5.785256240815536
bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters	6.3459692370203165
bennets heart but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property	7.683654622503612
bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty and more than once during dinner did mr	5.420488114075313
gardiner whose manners were easy and pleasant encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks mrs	3.9849951339858425
mary however continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them	5.78522736899914
collins wants to marry lizzy nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment but sir williams good breeding carried him through it all and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy	6.701300096299822
i should infinitely prefer a book but of this answer lydia heard not a word	5.5570389233347806
they must be a great loss to your family in darcys presence she dared not mention wickhams name but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moments distress but exerting herself vigorously to repel the illnatured attack she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone	5.469133087143243
in the former were many good paintings but elizabeth knew nothing of the art and from such as had been already visible below she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcys in crayons whose subjects were usually more interesting and also more intelligible	5.607478068595757
again she read on	9.157916520358755
yet indeed i am in earnest	9.549976934850518
did it said he did it soon make you think better of me	8.723326177766282
such an openness and gentleness in his manner there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men	6.1916762617422405
gardiner whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive	7.933969905750577
bennet followed her saying i am quite sorry lizzy that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself	7.404209759503233
at length however our kind friend procured the wishedfor direction	3.8027611920256024

bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room he was lively and unreserved danced every dance was angry that the ball closed so early and talked of giving one himself at netherfield	6.617405720496811
i am quite well	6.2728827947836665
risk any thing rather than her displeasure and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly at home and be satisfied that we shall take no offence believe me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention and depend upon it you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire	6.641953691624651
wickhams affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to find it not equal to lydias for him	7.45941563441821
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection	4.99368818251562
from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce	9.063853388340714
he spoke of apprehension and anxiety but his countenance expressed real security	5.557962698249321
gardiners coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment but this was declined and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness	6.497885710297402

gardiner though unknown	5.6117923509950485
if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often seemed likely the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him	5.981096675360292
we acted with the best intentions could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydias note to his wife he brought it with him for us to see jane then took it from her pocketbook and gave it to elizabeth	7.443306251498299
we want none of them do we darcy had walked away to another part of the room	7.32127594013728
if i have wounded your sisters feelings it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn them with respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injured mr	5.37556782621005
and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it	7.456440906500233
bingleys love i never saw a more promising inclination	6.945495609462425
miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her elizabeth listened in silence but was not convinced their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself she was very little disposed to approve them	7.5587337532913415
darcy had been staying there	7.113011830183429
the very last evening was spent there and her ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey gave them directions as to the best method of packing and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way that maria thought herself obliged on her return to undo all the work of the morning and pack her trunk afresh	6.622144223242966
but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet	6.302190806811003
it would have spared her she thought one sleepless night out of two	6.885387239513475
my affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation now forced herself to speak and immediately though not very fluently gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances	6.133968806824925
his revenge would have been complete indeed	6.490613657750315
you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased had you then persuaded yourself that i should indeed i had	6.4728069794460685

wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night names facts every thing mentioned without ceremony if it be not so let mr	5.949956361010786
collins sat down to quadrille and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino the two girls had the honour of assisting mrs	5.568997110888215
i mend pens remarkably well thank youbut i always mend my own how can you contrive to write so even he was silent	4.9960673592352665
she talked on therefore without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr	6.583645729432431
the eldest of them a sensible intelligent young woman about twentyseven was elizabeths intimate friend	5.087602660576621
and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty economy and other amiable qualifications indeed mr	8.132345931178238
upon the whole therefore she found what has been sometimes found before that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire did not in taking place bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself	6.765786041955386
collins which as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence she accordingly read and elizabeth who knew what curiosities his letters always were looked over her and read it likewise	6.0495735659164405
wickham ought not to be a clergyman	9.109203565030553

the happiest wisest most reasonable end in a few minutes she was joined by bingley whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose	8.087214990945402
let me congratulate you on a very important conquest the colour now rushed into elizabeths cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself when her father continued you look conscious	7.552412491368334
he shall be mercenary and she shall be foolish no lizzy that is what i do not choose	9.89591095312366
but my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend if we thought alike of miss bingley replied jane your representation of all this might make me quite easy	7.60442751367556
bingley and jane was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs	6.680474958732503
bennets acknowledgments he briefly replied with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again	7.08652927003278
i must confess myself surprised by your application i did not expect it from you	6.9076479696146444
but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede	7.398585143365093
the observations of her uncle and aunt now began and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected	7.9722692814093135
bingley might like you the best of the party my dear you flatter me	7.719303326279676
he took the hint and soon began with this seems a very comfortable house	6.39199199692904
she was of great use and comfort to us all and lady lucas has been very kind she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us and offered her services or any of her daughters if they could be of use to us she had better have stayed at home cried elizabeth perhaps she meant well but under such a misfortune as this one cannot see too little of ones neighbours	6.961631932537785
she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her	6.373183279812332
you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends and make him the contempt of the world neither duty nor honour nor gratitude replied elizabeth have any possible claim on me in the present instance	8.27260289698921
but now suppose as much as you chuse give a loose to your fancy indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford and unless you believe me actually married you cannot greatly err	5.110304978101021
he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper and before he went away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and mrs	5.529884140168574
both sisters were uncomfortable enough	6.352487542263451
bennet rang the bell and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library	7.837085574376835
but i cannoti have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly	5.861212443896388
in spite of her deeplyrooted dislike she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a mans affection and though her intentions did not vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive till roused to resentment by his subsequent language she lost all compassion in anger	7.083002157353325

bingley before expressed to her sister how very much she admired him	7.3741009832153415

having said thus much i feel no doubt of your secrecy	6.998443046469332

the supposition did not pain her	7.779082271654352

bennet was forced to submit to a separation which as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth	6.558421907168967

collins as the wisest thing she ever did	6.153222906832897
wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation though it was only on its being a wet night and on the probability of a rainy season made her feel that the commonest dullest most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker	6.246588749953621

i shall see her in january	7.546204070610668
the only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss her and who when it came to the point so little liked her going that he told her to write to him and almost promised to answer her letter	10.104818243213531
he meant to resign his commission immediately and as to his future situation he could conjecture very little about it	6.617150840048531
but that is one great difference between us	6.521774083589653
the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten	7.335934968395254
collinss making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted	5.642192198358142
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement she sent him language so very abusive especially of elizabeth that for some time all intercourse was at an end	7.065960897836141
she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry and while she steadily repressed it could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing that however long and for whatever cause his attentions had been withdrawn her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal	6.1005437084246585
darcy though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded for though he was not always looking at her mother she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her	8.950084030453288

had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility	6.328143811424324
my uncle cried jane what do you mean sir i mean that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred ayear during my life and fifty after i am gone that is very true said elizabeth though it had not occurred to me before	6.940266234429828
bingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of him care of him yes i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care	5.212957055066948

darcy had been overrated elizabeth had never yet answered mrs	5.7966225440695665
not a word however passed his lips in allusion to it till their visitor took his leave for the night but as soon as he was gone he turned to his daughter and said jane i congratulate you	7.169712994532273
we had better not mention it	7.743827406412579
he had never before supposed that could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement	7.6719721835498556
his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost	8.869360204909219
so much the man of fashion	9.333747363305758
to be sure you knew no actual good of mebut nobody thinks of that when they fall in love was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was ill at netherfield dearest jane	6.771743434394017
i will not encourage the impudence of either by receiving them at longbourn a long dispute followed this declaration but mr	4.77370719113459
her heart did whisper that he had done it for her	8.291101884740927
they were confined for the evening at different tables and she had nothing to hope but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself	8.768413491179667
my poor father	7.722143194413446
i was sometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane and for their sakes had patience with her	6.512648446780105
at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr	8.611077505549023
it was generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent	9.35394757822647
but georgiana would not join her	6.831828057651449

hill began instantly to express her joy	5.766470990645484
the wish of procuring her regard which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this	7.303748485523122
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements	4.907192771485343
he bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr	6.928397684394362
if you should have no objection to receive me into your house i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family monday november 18th by four oclock and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday senight following which i can do without any inconvenience as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day	5.383477886824471
my dear brother at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece and such as upon the whole i hope will give you satisfaction	8.149534765362898
but he is a liberal master i suppose and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham and therefore gave them to understand in as guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from his relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different construction and that his character was by no means so faulty nor wickhams so amiable as they had been considered in hertfordshire	7.249817767718166
i do not get on at all	6.098038718297285
i hope she will turn out well i dare say she will she has got over the most trying age did you go by the village of kympton i do not recollect that we did i mention it because it is the living which i ought to have had	7.817110520737252
yes she called yesterday with her father	8.157400495687783

it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you	7.185628470579026
i am sure said she i cried for two days together when colonel millars regiment went away	4.240275718094935
ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it	8.801399884646555
the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough and wickham who happened to sit near elizabeth began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies	6.67854199201281
bennet you will wait on him of course no no	9.62626700045038
as the weather was fine they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park every park has its beauty and its prospects and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in such raptures as mr	6.667176437204203
but the person who advanced was now near enough to see her and stepping forward with eagerness pronounced her name	6.050909812634004
yet he knew to the contrary himself	9.957444895748244
but that is not the case here	9.854217311566726
gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr	6.7596844413516814
she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to advantage	6.053485140282132
day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter a report which highly incensed mrs	6.468845179593574
but however he is very welcome to come to netherfield if he likes it	8.569075562843116
jenkinson in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes	6.1807689621669155
i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable	5.212793844486452
i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good	6.164792398340337
darcy walk into the room	6.522457744111663
denny to whom lydia eagerly applied and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before and was not yet returned adding with a significant smile i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here this part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was caught by elizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickhams absence than if her first surmise had been just every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make attention forbearance patience with darcy was injury to wickham	6.395903301177695
she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes	6.3496062887762985
i am not equal to it	6.72631718822005
about a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formed for her in london and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to ramsgate and thither also went mr	6.741929360429174
bingley had been a most delightful friend so easily guided that his worth was invaluable but she checked herself	5.731874740355464
i confess said he that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyships asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings	7.390938759774548
if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs	7.983186249221883
upon my honour i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as i have this evening and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room said mr	7.974449694675331
the venison was roasted to a turnand everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch	3.5034323534946448
collinss proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could	6.464801526165393
by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brothers admiration	7.188305751863613
but jane was to go home with her and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation	11.396869952385579
to the girls who could not listen to their cousin and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantlepiece the interval of waiting appeared very long	6.8351937728118966
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs	6.688708736952049
she answered him in the usual way and after a moments pause added my eldest sister has been in town these three months	7.53408380709892
nor did he seem much more at ease when he spoke his accent had none of its usual sedateness and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn and of her stay in derbyshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts	7.524345216495421
here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country	7.237652027814998
his pride in that direction may be of service if not to himself to many others for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by	8.182131939214567
she remembered also that till the netherfield family had quitted the country he had told his story to no one but herself but that after their removal it had been every where discussed that he had then no reserves no scruples in sinking mr	5.6660003016853
she danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking of wickham and of hearing that he was universally liked	7.927460619401872
you know him too well to doubt the rest	7.697693093327501
what can be the meaning of this said charlotte as soon as he was gone	9.303553635113882
but there was still something lurking behind of which prudence forbad the disclosure	4.482924250980898
gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself	6.8947742702535955
as he quitted the room elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance so full of contradictions and varieties sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination	5.637810283630868
bennet when elizabeth had read the note aloud if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness if she should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr	6.589118852122915
oh yes he was to come there with wickham you know	10.179061303061928
it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay oxford blenheim warwick kenelworth birmingham c	4.789139011907876
i owe all that i know of it to another not to you elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy	12.966403563296605
find such a woman as soon as you can bring her to hunsford and i will visit her allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer	7.940506721966357
between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship in spite of a great opposition of character bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness openness ductility of his temper though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied	7.129348414742215
a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant and the respect which he felt for her high rank and his veneration for her as his patroness mingling with a very good opinion of himself of his authority as a clergyman and his rights as a rector made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness selfimportance and humility	6.802107396753451
there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sisters being in town	7.751478532935721
but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art undoubtedly replied darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressed there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation	4.960996427419626
long has promised to introduce him i do not believe mrs	6.876354115190083
but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed	8.200557701566076
how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love	8.188731913286155
that will make thirteen with ourselves so there will be just room at table for him consoled by this resolution she was the better able to bear her husbands incivility though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr	6.173481866456954
lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and daughter	4.285610353690753
the rest of the evening brought her little amusement	6.942203382441541
as soon as jane had read mr	6.815210404718589
you alluded to something else	5.458378191062612
when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring any thing you had a fancy for these are home questionsand perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature	5.766585525313986
philips first brought her the news well so much the better	6.056544382569255
do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody lady catherine i have nothing farther to say	8.592760204265726
but now that my dear uncle is come i hope every thing will be well is my father in town yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you word and have you heard from him often we have heard only once	8.210287318164125
while these newlyborn notions were passing in their heads the perturbation of elizabeths feelings was every moment increasing	4.117742345349928
bennet had many grievances to relate and much to complain of	5.300287510198399
i should be glad to take a turn in it if you will favour me with your company go my dear cried her mother and shew her ladyship about the different walks	7.150366453380233
importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly	4.230271004051289
the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light which yesterday had produced	6.1206009254069755
wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself or provoked his dear sister elizabeth by introducing the subject of it and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet	7.147392120343959
he was on one side of her mother	10.248774926668046
i was angry perhaps at first but my anger soon began to take a proper direction i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at pemberley	6.865809129129945
from the drawingroom they could distinguish nothing in the lane and were indebted to mr	7.888478444200938
pray go to see them with sir william and maria	9.092309598585283
in the intervals of her discourse with mrs	7.528345108977223
well i was so frightened i did not know what to do for my uncle was to give me away and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day	10.284555106415624
my reasons for believing it are briefly theseit does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable	6.074001109744309
my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology you are not going to introduce yourself to mr	5.828242737739681
but you know married women have never much time for writing	6.060751241211992
collinss letter had done away much of her illwill and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters	7.968876888061441
elizabeth bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sit down for two dances and during part of that time mr	6.781600312494186
he merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention and my motherhow is she	6.983349459447458
i dare say you will find him very agreeable heaven forbid that would be the greatest misfortune of all to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate do not wish me such an evil when the dancing recommenced however and darcy approached to claim her hand charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence	6.53006247986079
but i am at his disposal	7.1746080194180095
my mother was taken ill immediately and the whole house in such confusion oh	8.056802111381373
it is a delightful thing to be sure to have a daughter well married continued her mother but at the same time mr	7.6155752188571935
allow me to say however that your fair partner does not disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated especially when a certain desirable event my dear miss eliza glancing at her sister and bingley shall take place	7.487890761599207
only think of that my dear he actually danced with her twice and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time	9.497616569954983
by teatime however the dose had been enough and mr	5.51982230922455
in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity and though prepared as he told elizabeth to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house he was used to be free from them there his civility therefore was most prompt in inviting mr	6.926656519241188
bingley but i am sure it will be too much for kitty	8.480391906093017
he was growing quite inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her	4.496262040023711
the discussion of mr	5.325735049135994
but i make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves	6.348621875585132
well girls said she as soon as they were left to themselves what say you to the day	8.015676812611172
bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him	6.6946129559889584
gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family jane heard them with horror	6.635938035026524
my father however is partial to mr	5.154533119253672
i can remember no symptom of affection on either side and had any thing of the kind been perceptible you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away	7.464291013147791
darcys behaviour astonished and vexed her	4.852068605528763
i knew how it would be	7.5654708650747295
she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange	8.138919494389382
jane was not happy	10.39476901047401
how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning mr	5.538103432912041
darcy drawing near elizabeth said to her do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel she smiled but made no answer	6.28522272145371
i wish i could see her	7.515952925103856
but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration and gave most gracious smiles especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them	4.885167622281369
bennet and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood	6.415743615675635
it was rather small but well built and convenient and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit	5.561799454868454
the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter and concluded with her brothers regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country	7.1350234912513955
how does georgiana get on darcy mr	4.190624122973935
bennet with civil selfcommand to miss lucas	5.092915338910985
gardiner was surprised and concerned but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to the charm of recollection and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of any thing else	7.5960394445504855
darcys farther notice though often standing within a very short distance of her quite disengaged he never came near enough to speak	6.357858835583764
the park paling was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground	7.211300494841794
she performed her part indeed without much graciousness but mrs	3.8105908884502107
i am sorry to hear that but why did not you tell me so before	7.485529680240141
but depend upon it mr	5.045202225989984
though lydias short letter to mrs	5.15925953612006
she had been unwilling to mention bingley and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend	8.024291166129576
respect esteem and confidence had vanished for ever and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown	5.159485606705494
my kind friends will not hear of my returning home till i am better	8.427117201700874
had his own happiness however been the only sacrifice he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best but her sisters was involved in it as she thought he must be sensible himself	7.783654622815678
his character is thereby complete i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time	7.748704372504276
so do not put yourself to inconvenience during their walk it was resolved that mr	6.886872545162863
bromley of course if you mention my name at the bell you will be attended to lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey and as she did not answer them all herself attention was necessary which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her or with a mind so occupied she might have forgotten where she was	7.294738025434642
indeed mr	5.908599788073166
bingley and jane she had never doubted but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them	7.540262681372537
a low phaeton with a nice little pair of ponies would be the very thing	6.887409934899948
darcythat to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself she highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a full discussion of it and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn and during the walk he particularly attended to her	7.639748520250584
she was afraid of talking longer of his friend and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him	8.058828279587525
i am glad i bought my bonnet if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox	5.550878038805107
wickhams attention was caught and after observing mr	5.991720200869937
she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow and she felt capable under such circumstances of endeavouring even to like bingleys two sisters	6.427774042613026
they have both said she been deceived i dare say in some way or other of which we can form no idea	7.045014502262265
but if otherwise if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object and even before two words have been exchanged nothing can be said in her defence except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham and that its illsuccess might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment	5.9435474622910665
we have dined nine times at rosings besides drinking tea there twice how much i shall have to tell elizabeth privately added and how much i shall have to conceal their journey was performed without much conversation or any alarm and within four hours of their leaving hunsford they reached mr	5.126569234618539
my dear father can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace mr	8.057448518955391
his choice is disinterested at least for he must know my father can give her nothing	7.7208340924277845
it was owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration that wickhams character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was	6.936117602393912
he studies too much for words of four syllables do not you darcy my style of writing is very different from yours oh cried miss bingley charles writes in the most careless way imaginable	5.267964114234656
and now heres mr	4.900997192471271
the family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them	8.55776942461129
on the contrary every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct who will believe me	7.917001935273251
gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit as they returned except what had particularly interested them both	6.77250573025026
elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance but she sat down resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man	6.286521546129338
my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never have called on us in this familiar way but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely even to charlottes wishes to be the case and after various conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do which was the more probable from the time of year	7.845324889590517
all elizabeths anger against him had been long done away but had she still felt any it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again	6.11201409270514
what a letter is this to be written at such a moment	9.769330001158067
darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sisters proficiency	6.943200436448653
from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr	6.7224126050097786
it was a large handsome stone building standing well on rising ground and backed by a ridge of high woody hillsand in front a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater but without any artificial appearance	3.11782113323235
i do think it is the hardest thing in the world that your estate should be entailed away from your own children and i am sure if i had been you i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail	7.962422355624204
some people call him proud but i am sure i never saw any thing of it	6.133248220906388
had elizabeths opinion been all drawn from her own family she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort	5.886780366090627
how i wanted you how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr	5.322573554987267
from what can it proceed	8.219614831407467
bingley was ready georgiana was eager and darcy determined to be pleased	7.101163539434172
her father captivated by youth and beauty and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her	5.199607005629693
it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to their support and whenever they changed their quarters either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills	5.225981405833318
my dear lizzy where can you have been walking to was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room and from all the others when they sat down to table	8.252901020907242
did you see him while you were at lambton	9.662578569398665
you have no compassion on my poor nerves you mistake me my dear	6.265802603711833
it is only that he has better means of having it than many others because he is rich and many others are poor	6.813719859267609
had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place	7.0202427685639295
nor was it under many many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them	8.366616753943328
lydia does not leave me because she is married but only because her husbands regiment happens to be so far off	7.284801523981642
i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression	6.843760029925246
five daughters brought up at home without a governess i never heard of such a thing	7.118874989055856
the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucass last week and even mr	6.298961766778908
i have a warm unguarded temper and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him and to him too freely	8.028571559860811
in the evening soon after mr	7.743333760854388
but he is an ugly fellow	6.946830571839031
their visits to mrs	5.279513711912825
elizabeth could not help saying it is very much to his credit i am sure that you should think so i say no more than the truth and what every body will say that knows him replied the other	8.679809156167504
wickham was perfectly friendly on his side even more	6.135158688367567
she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was satisfactory it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her	9.423575986684869
when to these recollections was added the developement of wickhams character it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful	6.142380294837191
when he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on and their uncle promised at parting to prevail on mr	5.936473962531632
bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf	5.1750405062027784
collins with all his solemn composure being run away with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther and he continued my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish	5.577048185698339
but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters mr	6.148069891795365
scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game except when mrs	6.070889135804987
her power was sinking every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness such an assurance of the deepest disgrace	6.062808529755271
i have not been accustomed to such language as this	5.6164144713526785
sir william had been delighted with him	9.548311742420697
bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time without making any impression on them	5.711271123733569
bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party	6.620128506435224
it could not be for society as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips and when he did speak it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choicea sacrifice to propriety not a pleasure to himself	5.853792071185031
darcy looking at the eldest miss bennet	8.49770688881888
i see what you are feeling replied charlotte you must be surprised very much surprised so lately as mr	6.298774444294028
but every body is to judge for themselves and the lucases are very good sort of girls i assure you	7.730223652744846
lydia was exceedingly fond of him	7.21753332002839
your own heart your own conscience must tell you why i come elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment	5.292137283063109
i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing	7.859334847323829
i want to be told whether i ought or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickhams character miss bennet paused a little and then replied surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully	6.540685945486407
astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her	5.291796970483673
she is my youngest girl but one	7.462216524647663
she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld	6.695898405903787
darcy indeed i am	8.907429005930952
i am going away myself no no nonsense lizzy i desire you will stay where you are and upon elizabeths seeming really with vexed and embarrassed looks about to escape she added lizzy i insist upon your staying and hearing mr	4.237053721926692
all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who but three months before had been almost an angel of light	4.583521872334545
at length however mrs	5.151369694923872
does that young lady know mr	5.4616752848373435
bingley and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being pleased and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be compared with his friend	6.6053037093846525
the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her	5.799252256787056
to kitty however it does not seem so wholly unexpected	5.963938290670204
it was on the contrary exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him as now when all love must be vain	7.242930095387924
sure he will not leave london before he has found them	9.187208320443718
their situation was awkward enough but hers she thought was still worse	5.222317503477759
be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy	7.845116079553917
the whole party before them indeed excited a lively attention	4.961602241613058
how could i be so silly as to wish it	9.21429359899162
if you received the work on a physical medium you must return the medium with your written explanation	5.325698824465235
can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him	6.179738324309758
could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections	8.728042100013784
the dinner too in its turn was highly admired and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its cookery was owing	6.300025673399544
but let me advise you to think better of it	8.908324402366965
he did every thing best in the world and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september than any body else in the country	8.027463474440367
bingley and talked of mrs	6.604669675589502
he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand	7.570161148490151
your reproof so well applied i shall never forget had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner those were your words	5.153340693648778
miss bennet i insist on being satisfied	6.5536690274681
he has made me so happy said she one evening by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring	7.544589427289217
darcy you cannot deny the fact i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party true and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room	7.57805596976815
the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited	6.93167298206648
they are my old friends	5.327616355953611
she seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute and never attended to mary at all	6.2783671479824745
collins was also in the same state of angry pride	7.365887998783098
elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia but while they were supported by their mothers indulgence what chance could there be of improvement	5.713540269673176
she tried however to compose herself to answer him with patience when he should have done	7.584127552654415
and what can he have to say something very much to the purpose of course	9.495225472274253
collins did not walk to rosings and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours	7.877352302827353
i will put on my things in a moment	7.7470951368265535
there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them for mr	4.657799999339158
when first he came in he had spoken to her but little but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention	10.176561360003449
elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not	8.538607533702924
i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it darcy mentioned his letter	7.556158804055492
hurst was observing their game	4.433275118239683
he was coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehension first got abroad it hastened his journey and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry	7.0416454695128365
she dared not even mention that gentleman	5.435951851257248
i knew that mr	5.143648725573511
she was going to the butchers she told me on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour	6.601768028304946
but when you have had time to think it all over i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done	11.196708588068855
his being so sure of succeeding was wrong said she and certainly ought not to have appeared but consider how much it must increase his disappointment indeed replied elizabeth i am heartily sorry for him but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me	6.6021388344190886
i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his society in town	6.827463185798161
had colonel forster seen denny himself yes but when questioned by him denny denied knowing any thing of their plan and would not give his real opinion about it	5.883505955594705
darcy is not in the least to blame that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way	9.482028995652366
you know sister we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it	5.7676111481469645
the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family	7.460236264589435
wickhams being among them	5.719376294485241
gardiner but perhaps to the lakes no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful	8.949461196788803
gardiner after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family told her that he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist mr	8.598188243005428
wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london and had she been able to receive them into her house they would have taken up their abode with her	8.350175729820204
i shall walk to meryton tomorrow to hear more about it and to ask when mr	7.984700708584997
he is a gentleman i am a gentlemans daughter so far we are equal true	6.985590573586374
have you heard from my uncle yes i have had a letter from him by express well and what news does it bring	8.557020311998585
he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion	7.185138820920596
when her mother went up to her dressingroom at night she followed her and made the important communication	8.153208981613442
the recollection of what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me	8.068806406044633
special rules set forth in the general terms of use part of this license apply to copying and distributing project gutenbergtm electronic works to protect the project gutenbergtm concept and trademark	4.7276718930227055
and besides no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road well thensupposing them to be in london	7.179370278703795
i know your disposition lizzy	5.821067982553109
it would be such a delicious scheme and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all	7.124112835448418
bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that instead of spending his whole income he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children and of his wife if she survived him	6.627896949508409
in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and see how every body went on but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme	7.4473086207792925
when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music	9.430837169539743
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse and that she could not leave her	10.093837744255
the turn of your countenance i shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me oh	7.685476799716318
anxiety on janes behalf was another prevailing concern and mr	3.9677311508553386
darcy replied with great intrepidity miss elizabeth bennet miss elizabeth bennet repeated miss bingley	5.999046330809151
your profusion makes me saving and if you lament over him much longer my heart will be as light as a feather poor wickham there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance	5.916144708756511
collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy and what am i to do on the occasion it seems an hopeless business speak to lizzy about it yourself	7.8600019396329355
i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied yes you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that	7.216095638759923
we have not met since the 26th of november when we were all dancing together at netherfield elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he afterwards took occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of the rest whether all her sisters were at longbourn	6.473190604031371
come be quick be quick	5.676462873328184
darcys explanation by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion heightened the sense of what jane had lost	6.898986409014077
she cared for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear of leaving wickham	7.512766743300587
she would not listen therefore to her daughters proposal of being carried home neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time think it at all advisable	7.028252341795314
darcy had been was much relieved by discerning such different feelings	5.018505794138783
he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london perfectly soi thank you she found that she was to receive no other answerand after a short pause added i think i have understood that mr	7.653759059955748
when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous	5.747368526472875
philips throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation	4.633493840071725
but from what the report of their engagement could originate elizabeth was at a loss to imagine till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley and her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made every body eager for another to supply the idea	8.286318239693106
your uncle is as much surprised as i amand nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done	9.64207272399152
one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune every thing in his favour should think highly of himself	6.376230009177118
she answered in the affirmative and unable to resist the temptation added when you met us there the other day we had just been forming a new acquaintance the effect was immediate	5.068348017340726
but it was not to be	8.656665559727713
darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr	8.08928206326092
collins was only a clergyman and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton	6.392172641840367
i am sure there is not on his	9.446413586056979
it must be my uncles doings	7.4507758681868586
i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed cried jane	5.194455336638864
your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage	5.889688529496348
but luckily he came back again in ten minutes time and then we all set out	7.293736233788668
collins or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge	6.86550218270326
bennets invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter	8.391928590786035
their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency	9.116797749277662
i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they drove from the town and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter	7.2929593284806185
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart and by a manoeuvre of mrs	7.322007337735767

having never even fancied herself in love before her regard had all the warmth of first attachment and from her age and disposition greater steadiness than first attachments often boast and so fervently did she value his remembrance and prefer him to every other man that all her good sense and all her attention to the feelings of her friends were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity	6.530909190943867
wickham of course wanted more than he could get but at length was reduced to be reasonable	8.058715843691314
she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it	5.416813849695821

and now do when you get to town find them out wherever they may be and if they are not married already make them marry	6.538337650292611
forster said she it will be quite shocking to send her away	7.017259564624486
it is a nice long walk and mr	5.113960838225931
miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy	9.268887124096352

can there be any other opinion on the subject yes there can for mine is totally different will you hear it most willingly you shall have it in few words	5.835488093488974
the business was therefore soon settled	7.082306375561596
his family knew him to be on all common occasions a most negligent and dilatory correspondent but at such a time they had hoped for exertion	6.464796899987134

collins would have led them round his two meadows but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost turned back and while sir william accompanied him charlotte took her sister and friend over the house extremely well pleased probably to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husbands help	5.627045329623829
when they sat down to supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely openly and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr	6.478179739107555
with a book he was regardless of time and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations	8.945920226419409
in revolving lady catherines expressions however she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference	6.6450550619637845
eliza bennet said miss bingley when the door was closed on her is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own and with many men i dare say it succeeds	7.253279204218949
she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr	4.242606802701166
collins has made an offer to lizzy and she will not have him charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by kitty who came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered the breakfastroom where mrs	7.603082374868294
collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherines being rather displeased by her staying at home	5.981091093895081
nothing was to be done that he did not do himself though i am sure and i do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your uncle would most readily have settled the whole	8.429684216284032

no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune or that may comfort you under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parents mind	5.155851091381824

darcy changed colour but the emotion was short and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued	5.401093364491917

had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing but his perfect indifference and your pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd	7.190827945990014
never even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield or his dignified relations at rosings had she seen him so desirous to please so free from selfconsequence or unbending reserve as now when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings	6.137236475993466

denny addressed them directly and entreated permission to introduce his friend mr	4.767107007279662
but no such recollection befriended her	5.090259285268215
but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your sisters countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished iti believed it on impartial conviction as truly as i wished it in reason my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me but there were other causes of repugnancecauses which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before me these causes must be stated though briefly the situation of your mothers family though objectionable was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your father pardon me it pains me to offend you	5.680643058739605

perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation	5.8437459960865885
family pride and filial pride for he is very proud of what his father was have done this	7.818205775355841
his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention the first to listen and to pity the first to be admired and in his manner of bidding her adieu wishing her every enjoyment reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh and trusting their opinion of hertheir opinion of every bodywould always coincide there was a solicitude an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard and she parted from him convinced that whether married or single he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing	7.046124343179511

he is certainly a good brother said elizabeth as she walked towards one of the windows	9.922234434014074
this cannot be	7.990852043112178
what is your own opinion that it ought not to be attempted	10.873923668635083
you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty	6.8983691007849455
the house furniture neighbourhood and roads were all to her taste and lady catherines behaviour was most friendly and obliging	7.10026784663288
he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her his style was not penitent but haughty	5.380683758120232
he shall not be in love with me if i can prevent it elizabeth you are not serious now i beg your pardon	8.354895774681015
she was met in the vestibule by lydia who flying to her cried in a half whisper i am glad you are come for there is such fun here what do you think has happened this morning mr	6.7823948123382
it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine both replied elizabeth archly for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds we are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure said he	7.270473535629945
i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place	5.441738163332271
the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again called it an age since they had met and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation	5.389118961906966
collins allowed him time to speak replied with an air of distant civility	6.647272899694545
caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceived herself that is right you could not have started a more happy idea since you will not take comfort in mine	7.194561330420881
what does he say	6.040983206363267
but they did pass away and mr	6.317437442258829
how i long to see her	6.52553307340029
for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter	9.376719578937273
bennet had no more to say and lady lucas who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken	6.044759127519733
she had turned away but on hearing herself called though in a voice which proved it to be mr	7.2461511552396525
had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these what would have been her sensations	6.5322349636166885
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him and mr	7.516692195565589
darcy her sister scarcely less so and as for mr	7.706059787832094
but if you will listen to his letter you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself no that i am sure i shall not and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all and very hypocritical	10.321530833581408
lady catherine de bourgh she replied has very lately given him a living	5.115076014237492
they will take care not to outrun their income	6.328889430260342
darcy might leave the country but that he should stand his ground yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week	6.119110835146127
she approached and saw the likeness of mr	4.979818157515679
their manner of living even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home was unsettled in the extreme	6.9237932291852715

let me hear what it is we are speaking of music madam said he when no longer able to avoid a reply	7.615151351695842
i was never more annoyed	5.678565015015486
pray make my excuses to pratt for not keeping my engagement and dancing with him tonight	4.2096125900720525
hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey and on their being seated a pause awkward as such pauses must always be succeeded for a few moments	5.754049470565503
no but it must be done soon most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote	8.262541913367206
i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest there is no occasion for any thing more	7.080698549339435
i am trying to make it out and what is your success she shook her head	6.364434736481866
do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart you are uniformly charming cried he with an air of awkward gallantry and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail of being acceptable to such perseverance in wilful selfdeception elizabeth would make no reply and immediately and in silence withdrew determined if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female	6.005438550920562
elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend for though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him	7.328384104088139
he will be forgot and we shall all be as we were before elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude but said nothing	7.034172430098881
your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic i do not know what to say to you	5.413565458126754
well lizzy continued her mother soon afterwards and so the collinses live very comfortable do they	6.29246707739333
it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because on such occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than mrs	5.424211723618085
have you never happened to see her there she was perfectly sensible that he never had but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet	8.659824031069022
you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles for you are wasting your time with me mr	6.577594697738678
she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass the quiet tenor of their usual employments the vexatious interruptions of mr	3.403434630208849
i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point	5.469617065883625
darcy handed the ladies into the carriage and when it drove off elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house	6.654707627332415
they saw much to interest but nothing to justify enquiry	7.143903526162927
the faces of both however were tolerably calm and no change was visible in either except that the loss of her favourite sister or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business had given something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty	6.142043637613257
but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sisters sentiments	6.942187577691295
breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth my dearest lizzy i find myself very unwell this morning which i suppose is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday	6.076995893147823
but i must tell you how it went off	6.778770544354791
darcy returned within the stated time	5.2859687080056865
and yet upon my honour i believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment	9.760809982651226
darcy with him and sat down again by her sister	9.353813509415136
of having another daughter married to mr	5.272476233513689
bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawingroom again and when tea was over glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies	8.647032672949782
such was miss lucass scheme and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon	6.088761232445798
collins for a few moments he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh	6.104440798214112
my dear dear lydia how merry we shall be together when we meet her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr	5.549942134603936
bingley met them with hopes that mrs	5.602752911633458
her answer was warmly in his favour	6.726444193130181
the pause was to elizabeths feelings dreadful	7.603230165099118
NUM e	7.37654767384869
only think what a miserable summer else we shall have yes thought elizabeth that would be a delightful scheme indeed and completely do for us at once	6.176772689286395
how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from ones own daughters i cannot understand and all for the sake of mr	5.9611712460856285
the party did not supply much conversation	7.8948831586504635
the idea soon reached to conviction as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her	7.260960302131371
gardiner highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master soon led again to the subject and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase	6.73335325232503
bingleys first choice yesbut he seemed to like his second better oh you mean jane i supposebecause he danced with her twice	4.892620557913233
bennet had been to epsom and clapham before his arrival but without gaining any satisfactory information and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town as mr	5.993252253800856
the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least if not by himself such a hope was cherished	8.365547382489442
that i had been with you you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone mary and kitty have been very kind and would have shared in every fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of them	7.708917781817775
i knew you would be wishing me joy nay if you are so serious about it i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled	7.187659991988476
while the family were in this confusion charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them	8.31029946115938
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer abovementioned and while mr	5.8342886885416645
she received him with her very best politeness which he returned with as much more apologising for his intrusion without any previous acquaintance with her which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice	8.370587058695403
collins gratefully accepted and immediately ordered	5.295801591762734
there are a few things that you can do with most project gutenbergtm electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement	6.604812785763189

no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard	4.482335039278475
wickham was sure to be one and on these occasions mrs	7.509138935440319
the subject was pursued no farther and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away	7.352733410221846
bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject and affectionately taking her hand said in reply do not make yourself uneasy my love	7.1406472497238305
he was resolutely silent however and from a determination of making him speak she continued i remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty and i particularly recollect your saying one night after they had been dining at netherfield she a beauty i should as soon call her mother a wit but afterwards she seemed to improve on you and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time yes replied darcy who could contain himself no longer but that was only when i first knew her for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance he then went away and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself	7.06272129219355
he could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when he was in town and why not to me	8.055507515985632
your examination of mr	5.122226785733261
you are too hasty sir she cried	5.270428085007118
wickham walked into the room elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before nor thinking of him since with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration	7.485982414778928
darcy she turned her eyes on the daughter she could almost have joined in marias astonishment at her being so thin and so small	8.01462902957894
pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us if i were as rich as mr	6.864356070576232
he seemed scarcely to hear her and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation his brow contracted his air gloomy	6.024176324926379
darcy while viewing the place instantly occurred	5.123608467572782
wickham and nothing less than a dance on tuesday could have made such a friday saturday sunday and monday endurable to kitty and lydia	5.71570229231766
i depend on you for that to these high flown expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her she saw nothing in it really to lament it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr	6.238647943592417
if she heard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen	9.035802974892992
after a short silence the lady first spoke	5.434735724526185
the day of his and lydias departure soon came and mrs	6.040287901934391
his arrival was soon known at the parsonage for mr	6.9676871493635275
i did for you	8.023996990277947
reynolds could interest her on no other point	6.531318279253517

for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know and read great books and make extracts mary wished to say something very sensible but knew not how	6.339946921877405
collins but i do not think there would have been any fun in it	7.64254399212048
collins knew not what to make of him	7.64396828604571
if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark	8.38130421737122
my dear brother replied mrs	4.820273027272094
but unluckily for her ladyship its effect had been exactly contrariwise	7.6862543881207115
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected	9.14404119607627
on entering the room he seemed to hesitate but jane happened to look round and happened to smile it was decided	6.755914469609672

their table was superlatively stupid	4.392347960107176
but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities replied her uncle	9.631090612096083
it was a large wellproportioned room handsomely fitted up	4.421780402041381
she saw instantly that her cousins manners were not altered by his marriage his formal civility was just what it had been and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family	6.500110933999064
as it was certain however that somebody was coming bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion and walk away with him into the shrubbery	6.919405461775029
a flirt too in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite	5.147426821323151
bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life	7.226541139822754
but in all and in almost every line of each there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style and which proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards every one had been scarcely ever clouded	6.968789898532165
bennet would have been very miserable but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield	6.9731706405665586
when they had gained their own room jane taking out the letter said this is from caroline bingley what it contains has surprised me a good deal	6.203867421279907

he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening	9.461332756197171
gardiner left them soon after breakfast	7.085408117407803
this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife but where other powers of entertainment are wanting the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given	5.478172920460715
what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer did mr	6.83831149139927
darcys conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole	7.004689839578098

lizzy you must not do so	10.09494669924352
with his notions of dignity he would probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous contained much good sense and solid reasoning	5.434393208515333
one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty lizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now indeed i could not	6.62530596957547
bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr	7.011612397270677
there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule or disgust him into silence and he was more communicative and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him	5.309848233235647
he had to be sure done much	8.325669931288132
their first subject was her sister and she was more grieved than astonished to hear in reply to her minute enquiries that though jane always struggled to support her spirits there were periods of dejection	6.522485020290592
but on returning to the drawingroom when her letter was finished she saw to her infinite surprise there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her	8.430162366194475
but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue she could easily conjecture	4.638074616768683

who attended to you	9.47611152517196
he had certainly formed such a plan and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend	8.359491736506966
her brothers recommendation was enough to ensure her favour his judgment could not err and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable	6.6428603866788
we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage she may have less trouble in achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way	7.408285239969228
if he did shrug his shoulders it was not till sir william was out of sight	6.011137816214014

mamma would like to go too of all things	7.491132932891859
though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds or any thing like it has been advanced	5.798675548871129

if we make haste said lydia as they walked along perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes in meryton they parted the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers wives and elizabeth continued her walk alone crossing field after field at a quick pace jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity and finding herself at last within view of the house with weary ancles dirty stockings and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise	4.598171353948402
i only hope they may have half my good luck	5.951503688289636
we were always good friends and now we are better true	7.3437743487754785
i pity though i cannot help blaming her	6.439281450382598
this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much	8.095300927795938
you know not what you are about elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply and at length by repeated assurances that mr	5.574682197860186
the rain continued the whole evening without intermission jane certainly could not come back	5.991027022223979
bingley and his eldest sister to observe the game	6.928668568268882
think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind	6.72945438003155
i take up my pen again to do what i have just told you i would not but circumstances are such that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible	7.648058372953281
he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again there is some sense in what he says about the girls however and if he is disposed to make them any amends i shall not be the person to discourage him though it is difficult said jane to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his credit elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine and his kind intention of christening marrying and burying his parishioners whenever it were required	6.502668046218605
but whatever may be the sentiments which mr	6.3250004198673
as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consult together as to what is to be done oh	8.832668075540573
have you seen any pleasant men	5.3764297734930615
he found her as handsome as she had been last year as good natured and as unaffected though not quite so chatty	7.348590548966647
my youngest sister has left all her friendshas elopedhas thrown herself into the power ofof mr	4.74835483240543
you may have drawn him in if i have i shall be the last person to confess it miss bennet do you know who i am	10.488823762432718
i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible amiable wellinformed woman for the rest of her life though perhaps it was lucky for her husband who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly	7.371367573921789
when this was done she had a less active part to play	8.313296200653742
in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away	7.540201300283936
but really maam i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first	7.003743192801502
elizabeth could not but be pleased could not but triumph	7.476389789616216
when the engagement was for home some of the officers always made part of it of which officers mr	7.238775971783129
darcys using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has been always remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated mr	6.252262468182676
philips understood from him what rosings was and who was its proprietor when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherines drawingrooms and found that the chimneypiece alone had cost eight hundred pounds she felt all the force of the compliment and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeepers room	6.492042730923147
i have an excessive regard for jane bennet she is really a very sweet girl and i wish with all my heart she were well settled	7.536278368786332
she was quite amazed at her own discomposure but amongst other causes of disquiet she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour and more than commonly anxious to please she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her	5.714024994427672
he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room	5.582521250387958
darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended and therefore checked her laugh	7.392818592248187
the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they met	7.883618155422868
the first mentioned was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached mr	7.156130623039423
a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given but it could not be kept without difficulty for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade and he was at the same time exercising great selfdenial for he was longing to publish his prosperous love	5.067053520465733
i am ashamed of you	7.486838054459235
bingley himself instead of a ceremonious card	7.450365215220825
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickhams departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment	6.884342598207726
who would have thought she could be so thin and small she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind	6.743065416911544
and when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether mr	5.323224815290606
yet it is hard she sometimes thought that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired without raising all this speculation	6.010152259707819
but what is to be done about pemberley cried mrs	6.107468300317687
bingley was all grateful pleasure and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from london whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time	7.2663931745631585
their other engagements were few as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the collinses reach	7.246441361924988
you will be a very happy woman jane went to him instantly kissed him and thanked him for his goodness	8.254736777114482
bingley for his kindness to jane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy	5.768162423234954
that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny	8.375319105319665
they had often attempted it before but it was a subject on which mrs	7.674909059024275
bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life every body had been most kind and attentive to him there had been no formality no stiffness he had soon felt acquainted with all the room and as to miss bennet he could not conceive an angel more beautiful	7.788609146097709
single my dear to be sure	11.566068486387614
darcy contradict it	5.572432419457989
there was now an interest however in believing the housekeeper and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old and whose own manners indicated respectability was not to be hastily rejected	6.5658915499815365
i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back	8.560947490647127
but i must write no more	7.5603464960896005
bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings though she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour and when mr	5.880351563006739
he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood and his civilities were worn out like his information	6.247184750528178
darcy they are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me to determine it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline cried her brother because he does not write with ease	6.9297080320826385
bingley will be very glad to see you and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy i desire you will do no such thing	8.962795670332527
bennets curiosity and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject	6.03122175037476
i always said it must be so at last	8.058944680411024
she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could provided he chose with discretion and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself some shelves in the closets up stairs	6.018623792137793
she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas who often joined them and goodnaturedly engaged mr	5.347254661073432
but it must not shall not be	9.591463243572287
you have now done your duty by her and must fret no longer but my dear sister can i be happy even supposing the best in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere you must decide for yourself said elizabeth and if upon mature deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife i advise you by all means to refuse him how can you talk so said jane faintly smiling you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i could not hesitate i did not think you wouldand that being the case i cannot consider your situation with much compassion but if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be required	6.193685866817118
if youll believe me i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there a fortnight	6.7491338957008
how acutely did she now feel it	6.6382717157599975
but at last your uncle was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it which went sorely against the grain and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise where it was due	6.108121110192446
darcys sometimes coming there stopped her and instead of entering the park she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road	5.787161233128078

four nieces of mrs	5.409149312522676
gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingleys visit in gracechurchstreet and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself which proved that the former had from her heart given up the acquaintance	6.395056335071857
you cannot have been always at longbourn elizabeth looked surprised	9.407860794182124
is not this an agreeable surprise and we mean to treat you all added lydia but you must lend us the money for we have just spent ours at the shop out there then shewing her purchases look here i have bought this bonnet	5.54290370917731
i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant of it that they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probablebut his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger perhaps this concealment this disguise was beneath me it is done however and it was done for the best on this subject i have nothing more to say no other apology to offer	7.510117636722679
but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them	7.310849418086315

his character was to speak for itself	9.358736119356184
you certainly do she replied with a smile but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome i should be sorry indeed if it were	7.982961340342506

though i know it must be a scandalous falsehood though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible i instantly resolved on setting off for this place that i might make my sentiments known to you if you believed it impossible to be true said elizabeth colouring with astonishment and disdain i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far	7.984313910256027

he spoke well but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride	7.9382383099661356

elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation now put herself forward to confirm his account by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which she was readily joined by jane and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match the excellent character of mr	6.704372667405735
collins said she speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship i suspect his gratitude misleads him and that in spite of her being his patroness she is an arrogant conceited woman i believe her to be both in a great degree replied wickham i have not seen her for many years but i very well remember that i never liked her and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent	7.657271561749352

my temper would perhaps be called resentful my good opinion once lost is lost for ever that is a failing indeed cried elizabeth	5.026507550806287
and they are really to be married cried elizabeth as soon as they were by themselves	11.42899825078314
are you out of your senses to be accepting this man	9.481827768117288
he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter he had never seen a more elegant woman for she had not only received him with the utmost civility but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening although utterly unknown to her before	7.019166021715341
with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself	7.151092062866278
gardiner would have been highly gratified by her nieces beginning the subject	7.561843342812526
put them next to your great uncle the judge	5.771370813417725
wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow and if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant	7.366155213132612
wickham did not play at whist and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia	7.1449326237283275
lydias intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten every sister except mary agreed to go with her and mr	7.163401419631412
he is the kind of man indeed to whom i should never dare refuse any thing which he condescended to ask	7.622236689836418
she followed him with her eyes envied every one to whom he spoke had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee and then was enraged against herself for being so silly	6.296363523798468
first of all he asked miss lucas	9.125582704950542
collins being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader was extremely well pleased to close his large book and go	5.606305313621721
has he has my nephew made you an offer of marriage your ladyship has declared it to be impossible it ought to be so it must be so while he retains the use of his reason	6.975532970478553
wickham were and that he had seen and talked with them both wickham repeatedly lydia once	7.488171226058296
sometimes one officer sometimes another had been her favourite as their attentions raised them in her opinion	6.3604651639864125
collins and the convenient distance of hunsford from london	6.516334269391767
darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london	9.271245932476429
to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said you are mistaken mr	6.1764324092416825
yesthe handsomest young lady that ever was seen and so accomplished she plays and sings all day long	4.52461148893181
teaze himlaugh at him intimate as you are you must know how it is to be done but upon my honour i do not	8.39072045076831
their fortune on both sides is splendid	4.500807550367774
wickham had accepted their uncles invitation and was then in the house	7.9197433318030654
after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropt	5.460322754121456
bennet for many years after lydias birth had been certain that he would	7.617601076535388
no i can much more easily believe mr	7.850650822751609
at such an assembly as this it would be insupportable	7.997943661498156
in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself	5.192494074163981
you will easily comprehend from these particulars that mr	5.127404175913612
it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour	8.170250995397218
bennet indeed said little but the ladies were ready enough to talk and mr	6.579902360763947
but i confess they would have no charms for me	7.312465802081533
but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general	7.644865845946541
i know little of the game at present said he but i shall be glad to improve myself for in my situation of life mrs	8.548296018804491
my dear jane i am in such a flutter that i am sure i cant write so i will dictate and you write for me	7.32389406888008
in pompous nothings on his side and civil assents on that of his cousins their time passed till they entered meryton	5.886955393553802
her ladyships carriage is regularly ordered for us	4.70984496429754
the day passed most pleasantly away the morning in bustle and shopping and the evening at one of the theatres	6.402291576657013
miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty but she smiled too much	9.044765416759219
after a slight preparation for good news the letter was read aloud	5.501443084999859
bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight but my father cannot he wrote last week to hurry my return oh	4.646433986818062
bingley and netherfield	6.496313194536106
did you on reading it give any credit to its contents she explained what its effect on her had been and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed	6.622661035261046
he is gone to my father already	9.41311980723126
you look pale	7.53080942514859
i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections	6.491520163207317
and as to laughter we will not expose ourselves if you please by attempting to laugh without a subject	6.715148373964652
sir i do indeed	11.310028636234774
it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be near so much like a ball miss bingley made no answer and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room	7.019583828684002
as they drove to mr	5.621910033809475
wholly inattentive to her sisters feelings lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy calling for every ones congratulations and laughing and talking with more violence than ever whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish	4.811693449684174
it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth but now as soon as they were alone together she said i saw you look at me today lizzy when my aunt told us of the present report and i know i appeared distressed	7.580002138068174
the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherines drawingroom	6.588214593303196
how are you all my mother is tolerably well i trust though her spirits are greatly shaken	7.373369235840183
gardiner is it possible cried elizabeth when she had finished	9.204542851440085
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance	6.707890265231268
he has not an illnatured look	6.326048162371138
bennet we shall have her at netherfield at last she did indeed	9.748648778846105
collins however was not discouraged from speaking again and mr	6.186247098109902
it was not in her nature however to increase her vexations by dwelling on them	5.087628114779366
do you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on them as nonsense	6.74906095870689
darcy is not to be laughed at cried elizabeth	6.989957631416736
wickham no i certainly am not	8.327664020969054
she was teazed by mr	4.931960087678572
gardiner has done for them because wickham has not sixpence of his own	7.387269975341143
as they walked home elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen but though jane would have defended either or both had they appeared to be wrong she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister	6.993730852197992
you were mr	7.149846773635672
you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you elizabeths astonishment was beyond expression	5.340923627585676
are not you curious to hear how it was managed no really replied elizabeth i think there cannot be too little said on the subject la	8.489364874612034
they have some of the finest woods in the country elizabeth said no morebut her mind could not acquiesce	7.6609938635972625
but lizzy you can tell us whether it is like or not mrs	6.692161802565089
collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies and sir william to elizabeths high diversion was stationed in the doorway in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way	5.52199060389705
every thing being settled between them mr	6.598584030527024
the consequence of it is that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever	9.397469402150769
it cannot be done too much and when i next write to her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account	9.33297712349545
say that urgent business calls us home immediately	4.567809832788502
it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner	7.196813582387727
colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time but mr	6.873685565075366
he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her and in spite of every thing was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune	6.333624719388683
she was even sensible of some pleasure though mixed with regret on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr	5.275574702338726
or in other words you are determined to have him	8.071614763617442
gardiner then rallied her niece on wickhams desertion and complimented her on bearing it so well	4.03367605837381
thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i assure you there are many amiable young women	5.645759382281055
thensome time or other we shall be happy to hear you	8.345241613681274
they went to the library therefore and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her	8.722146558231882
the moral will be perfectly fair	7.589375634962399
my dear said maria quite shocked at the mistake it is not lady catherine	6.705148275525256
too much i am afraid for what becomes of the moral if our comfort springs from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the subject	7.112342069777422
my dear hill have you heard the good news	6.893197308908209
the old lady is mrs	5.49899979840807
but to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were seemed unjustifiable	5.078245719369776
for my part i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody	10.574849823361852
and you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner kitty who took all these threats in a serious light began to cry	6.93772444696645
she followed her father to the fire place and they both sat down	9.495298360246403
NUM f NUM	4.3175970974974875
vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used synonimously	4.556489266782425
bennet perhaps surpassing the rest though when the first tumult of joy was over she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while	7.653667964675999
wickham perhaps is my favourite but i think i shall like your husband quite as well as janes chapter xviii	6.636341968137751
colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object	7.054608333353471
had he done his duty in that respect lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her	6.361348334947362
elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane on their first arrival at lambton and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there but on the third her repining was over and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere	7.6008371880105186
we may as well leave them by themselves you know said her mother as soon as she was in the hall	9.528089589776966
if an individual project gutenbergtm electronic work is derived from the public domain does not contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the copyright holder the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in the united states without paying any fees or charges	4.609654624627282
bingley was incomprehensible	5.8665986746508425
darcy only entered the room	5.891180372004521
wickham wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparison but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read if in the explanation of them which is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours i can only say that i am sorry the necessity must be obeyedand farther apology would be absurd i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your eldest sister to any other young woman in the country but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment i had often seen him in love before at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william lucass accidental information that bingleys attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage	7.099484051282291
but jane knows as well as i do what wickham really is	6.706388981894229
her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone	9.412255788041863
gardiner soon wrote again to his brother	7.262388122794799
you give me fresh life and vigour	5.842411866151736
jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourghs being too hot or too cold or having too much or too little light	4.827150036213357
bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them on their first coming to london before they procured lodgings	8.20098751897124
she would be in nobodys way you know in that part of the house mr	8.949161856598199
if he had not had a family of his own i and my children must have had all his money you know and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him except a few presents	10.444872966268766
of all his sisters falsehood and contrivance	7.966106206790923
conjectures as to the meaning of it rapid and wild hurried into her brain but she was satisfied with none	7.306530679992169
sir william and lady lucas are determined to go merely on that account for in general you know they visit no new comers	6.11496552893351
the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place	5.683050998684677
bingley since you went away said mrs	5.235135471915164
forster promised to have a little dance in the evening by the bye mrs	9.511186485833159
it would be dreadful	7.376986640086231
do not repeat what i then said	7.961588771254502
bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended soninlaw that she ventured not to speak to him unless it was in her power to offer him any attention or mark her deference for his opinion	7.359315597042511
and who knows what may happen	6.097886713786788
i am sorry it went off	4.372561051062828
you may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion after seeing as you probably might the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday are you much acquainted with mr	5.962445519089111
i shall send this by express that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer	4.997269839552091
darcy could have such boundless influence	6.566988639262721
among those who are at all his equals in consequence he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous	9.558398614803126
what could your ladyship propose by it at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted your coming to longbourn to see me and my family said elizabeth coolly will be rather a confirmation of it if indeed such a report is in existence if	6.732761190115366
it is enough to know they are discovered i have seen them both then it is as i always hoped cried jane they are married elizabeth read on i have seen them both	8.466267522887492
miss bingley saw all this likewise and in the imprudence of anger took the first opportunity of saying with sneering civility pray miss eliza are not the shire militia removed from meryton	6.885188238016085
on opening the door she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth as if engaged in earnest conversation and had this led to no suspicion the faces of both as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other would have told it all	5.39862364589343
we can all begin freelya slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement	5.8994549041328925
the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value she was now on being settled at home at leisure to observe the real state of her sisters spirits	6.838077419981812
she was on the point of continuing her walk when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park he was moving that way and fearful of its being mr	6.004938530841493
what could be the meaning of it it was impossible to imagine it was impossible not to long to know	9.806349084533649
after sitting for a moment in silence she said very stiffly to elizabeth i hope you are well miss bennet	7.902221615705963
she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance mrs	8.182644409141595
darcys contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way	7.001908386338752
bennet delighted to speak to a lady catherine	9.827301674803378
he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be undecided	10.242013728776486
that he was not a goodtempered man had been her firmest opinion	6.75168230918353
i did not wink at you she then sat still five minutes longer but unable to waste such a precious occasion she suddenly got up and saying to kitty come here my love i want to speak to you took her out of the room	5.670050266378526
i shall like it of all things	8.116821603573733
this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers but mrs	9.242450274064856
but he is beyond all comparison the most agreeable man i ever sawand if he becomes really attached to mei believe it will be better that he should not	6.82017832096009
what does mr	5.679380100762655
as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer	11.432676439887187
why did she come	8.54894448170808
i know how much you dislike him you know nothing of the matter	7.899391711523794
pray do my dear miss lucas she added in a melancholy tone for nobody is on my side nobody takes part with me i am cruelly used nobody feels for my poor nerves charlottes reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth	5.613654474722755
wickham suspended amongst several other miniatures over the mantlepiece	4.34325253879451
only look at her	8.529135137966549
darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them	8.409051870374782
wickham undoubtedly by design for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs	5.174123224145598
the park was very large and contained great variety of ground	5.696115083944342
in seeing bingley her thoughts naturally flew to her sister and oh	6.373444374648874
she was very equal therefore to address mr	5.326790462992951
i began to be afraid you would never come back again	9.622775031435182
she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings and had sent for him only the saturday before to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening	6.145110133906141
elizabeth soon heard from her friend and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been that it should be equally unreserved was impossible	7.744671628069889
bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickhams removal from the shire as clearly as mr	6.432247636862656
what will you think of my vanity	12.140957937444895
he is rich to be sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane	5.887585388839001
with respect to wickham the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood it was yet a well known fact that on his quitting derbyshire he had left many debts behind him which mr	6.035777028635281
what is mr	6.723242598746893
the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new yet i think it is well expressed to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting	6.842842507492768
in the next room is a new instrument just come down for hera present from my master she comes here tomorrow with him mr	5.9341119204987
there was no one therefore who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him	7.427298992515224
i enquired after their brother of course	7.3010710830314345
the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening	7.436314032727713
bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend	6.8507205253520835
about the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting ready for a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion and after listening a moment she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry and calling loudly after her	6.793803969032369
if i said mr	6.118175405232529
darcy only can answer but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about	9.12781255169114
a little time therefore i shall certainly try to get the better with a stronger voice she soon added i have this comfort immediately that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side and that it has done no harm to any one but myself my dear jane exclaimed elizabeth you are too good	7.756867967486834
that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr	5.821784145234734
if you wish to charge a fee or distribute a project gutenbergtm electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set forth in this agreement you must obtain permission in writing from both the project gutenberg literary archive foundation and michael hart the owner of the project gutenbergtm trademark	3.959779126148288
wickham had resolved on quitting the militia	5.454393591600724
she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all till late in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself	7.748797346591433
as that was the case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it necessary to make our knowledge public for of what use could it apparently be to any one that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown	7.884333806765422
they stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made some slight observation on the dance	7.337509771080639
the adieu is charity itself	4.297525053816223
forster should not ask me as well as lydia said she though i am not her particular friend	7.543968779329769
she was convinced that she could have been happy with him when it was no longer likely they should meet	9.517560773238529
if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield said mrs	6.39802987199494
it is really too distressing	5.669173248771196
but she is perfectly amiable and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies has she been presented	5.1691039217038055
the church ought to have been my professioni was brought up for the church and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now indeed yesthe late mr	6.7077407216041856
i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning	6.50220234876827
no no let me shift for myself and perhaps if i have very good luck i may meet with another mr	6.381976647105865
she must own that she was tired of great houses after going over so many she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains	5.0307069811773735
my aunt she continued is going tomorrow into that part of the town and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenorstreet she wrote again when the visit was paid and she had seen miss bingley	7.074957462929796
it was a journey of only twentyfour miles and they began it so early as to be in gracechurchstreet by noon	6.214626131218243
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for herthat she was not enough recovered but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right	7.933432334776431
the first part of mrs	7.247951612490918
she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do and it was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his weakest side	7.75621559416982
contact the foundation as set forth in section NUM below	4.657691667438735
bennet said only nonsense nonsense what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation cried he	5.379611748349309
bennet said she it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house that i should be forced to make way for her and live to see her take my place in it my dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts	8.516782712344746
is not disposed to depend upon their marriage he shook his head when i expressed my hopes and said he feared w	5.964606136111135
and in the first place let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away	7.916946065916449
very odd and you only the second the younger ones out before the elder are married your younger sisters must be very young yes my youngest is not sixteen	6.534608360498672
colonel fitzwilliam who led the way was about thirty not handsome but in person and address most truly the gentleman	4.525193359992137
as all conversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left the room	5.756179073403789
or why did he thus come a day before he was expected	8.205897865719404
she was dying to know what could be his meaning and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him	7.2859253986063255
what is it you are talking of	9.78601824311216
jane was beyond competition her favourite child	5.878943209472769
i shall not go away till you have given me the assurance i require and i certainly never shall give it	6.958853967128553
i will answer for it he never cared three straws about her	6.041120616870155
my dear dear aunt she rapturously cried what delight	4.632597320903474
he delighted in going to pemberley especially when he was least expected	7.688533325045759
bennet gone away and i know he will fight wickham wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to become of us all	7.348456038306044
for though your accusations were illfounded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof	4.646999263149446
oh jane take care my dear lizzy you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday and mrs	8.324260086684129
between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again	6.1888428128575095
these two girls had been above an hour in the place happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner watching the sentinel on guard and dressing a sallad and cucumber	4.2144290221036655
such a disappointment	9.393716575922358
a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features but he said not a word and elizabeth though blaming herself for her own weakness could not go on	6.793005054416905
the rooms were lofty and handsome and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor but elizabeth saw with admiration of his taste that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine with less of splendor and more real elegance than the furniture of rosings	5.516506854838481
there was certainly at this moment in elizabeths mind a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance	6.808972970487637
and is this all cried elizabeth	6.831614205719653
but that is nothing to us	9.916368780816427
she got up and ran out of the room and returned no more till she heard them passing through the hall to the diningparlour	7.820215309405951
she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be	7.949960386411896
but her mind was so busily engaged that she did not always know when she was silent	8.972539301721763
bingley followed his advice	5.1870311109092855
bennet sat quite still and unable to utter a syllable	4.603695825422523
i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society my dearest friend but we will hope at some future period to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence	5.479865025106376
amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her life	7.580011692107481
there was no arguing upon such a project	7.719751660847051
darcy could not have	9.658032316911145
darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes not at all he replied they were brightened by the exercise a short pause followed this speech and mrs	6.016292743282775
i am sick of them all	7.479967020313391
my dear mr	4.7073906382066415
she felt it so and though in looking forward neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister in looking back to what they had feared only two hours ago she felt all the advantages of what they had gained	6.7058216629018865
i cannot see why mrs	5.020655108320733
her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming	8.429214114622653
i am always glad to get a young person well placed out	6.1619625876760615
society i own is necessary to me	6.11328467653385
but i knew i should persuade you at last	8.874244301782175
i cannot think of it without abhorrence we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening said elizabeth	7.0337050025868635
on applying to see the place they were admitted into the hall and elizabeth as they waited for the housekeeper had leisure to wonder at her being where she was	9.72415520897157
elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal that her mother though often disheartened had never yet despaired of succeeding at last	5.694011287322245
darcy thought she	7.944981963808876
jane was by no means better	6.85627008671428
it must be an amusing study yes but intricate characters are the most amusing	5.389513598163624
but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire she saw him from her dressingroom window enter the paddock and ride towards the house	5.964927653113452
it had come with a fare from london and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and ladys removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make enquiries at clapham	6.291523967576117
my dear mr	4.7073906382066415
it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man you are very cruel said her sister you will not let me smile and are provoking me to it every moment how hard it is in some cases to be believed and how impossible in others but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge that is a question which i hardly know how to answer	7.511472371776453
how much you must have gone through her sister however assured her of her being perfectly well and their conversation which had been passing while mr	8.457201959830384
bingley to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time without the ceremony of a formal invitation	7.399496475824645
the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source of happiness were within thirty miles of each other	6.313643327729506
be that as it may she saw him go with regret and in this early example of what lydias infamy must produce found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business	6.006080546387219
had i but explained some part of it onlysome part of what i learnt to my own family	8.064549097021477
bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him	7.885329969208448
i will read it to you when my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business which took him to london might be concluded in three or four days but as we are certain it cannot be so and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again we have determined on following him thither that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel	7.166509498018796
i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that	7.365617382845443
darcy and all that he had suffered from him was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr	7.288499322633507
though suspicion was very far from miss bennets general habits she was absolutely incredulous here	6.634227567472533
she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else i deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried elizabeth i am not a great reader and i have pleasure in many things in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said bingley and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying	6.596449267153008
wont it kitty kitty owned that she had rather stay at home	5.763293097696742
i thought i should have died	7.1880128360530025
they were then with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance taken into the house and as soon as they were in the parlour he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode and punctually repeated all his wifes offers of refreshment	5.9354277886433575
you comply with all other terms of this agreement for free distribution of project gutenbergtm works	5.361442967430165
hurst were going out	5.908670067869437
darcy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continued you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it again his astonishment was obvious and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification	7.804667991208886
steady to his purpose he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour he adhered most conscientiously to his book and would not even look at her	6.9294658717872695
till i have your disposition your goodness i never can have your happiness	7.888791191201002
long does not come back till the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce him for she will not know him herself then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce mr	9.392435276772884
indeed eliza you will be as welcome to me as either of them the wedding took place the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual	7.5287155492306095
did you speak from your own observation said she when you told him that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring from the former	7.499358484871935
he repeated the question with some surprise at her silence	7.3500364965978
colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a wellbred man and talked very pleasantly but his cousin after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs	5.573032447690194
her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence she had no conversation no style no taste no beauty	5.25870871625843
i know you will do him such ample justice that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent	5.793930733370574
but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule such as vanity and pride yes vanity is a weakness indeed	5.329869460224143
he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty he had heard much but he saw only the father	8.130635666658902
from elizabeths thoughts it was never absent	7.534158506798946
but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object	8.650850536703041
they look upon it quite as their own i dare say whenever that happens it was a subject which they could not mention before me no	7.5494281968169075
forgive the questionare you quite certain that you can be happy with him there can be no doubt of that	9.07072971885422
bennets ill humour or ill health	4.364584383881564

nothing on the contrary could be more natural and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both and could very sincerely wish him happy	5.850517836442033
collins expected the scene to inspire and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh	5.6495982848440764
they had nothing to accuse him of but pride pride he probably had and if not it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small markettown where the family did not visit	7.826460817824183
what a fine thing for our girls how so	5.539726451903586
a great deal more passed at the other table	7.935627884262047
after welcoming their sisters they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords exclaiming is not this nice	4.036758619210998
she has two nieces of her own	7.750148715812788
bennet by talking in this way	6.142084636050695
he could even listen to sir william lucas when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st	5.13630301933944
and this is always the way with him she added whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment	8.724417566612807
darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was ignorant of the truth myself	9.255889644228162
i am only ashamed of his asking so little and they must marry	8.459783993718458
bennet had married economy was held to be perfectly useless for of course they were to have a son	7.336827516563106
what pinmoney what jewels what carriages you will have	5.275420763508029
perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease yet there had been that in his voice which was not like ease	9.203361273241143
reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy drawn when she was only eight years old	7.484257304059557
she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you jane shook her head	6.928316919123648
annesley is with her	6.653351791268032
his sense of her inferiorityof its being a degradationof the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding but was very unlikely to recommend his suit	6.181593570096042
we must have mrs	7.285896602213617
gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing remained to be done but to go and elizabeth after all the misery of the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longbourn	8.87285215075004
she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery	6.7045300251463145
it convinced her that accident only could discover to mr	4.396059906412239
then observed elizabeth you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman yes i do comprehend a great deal in it oh	7.243153620012671
your friend performs delightfully he continued after a pause on seeing bingley join the group and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself mr	5.808105312496791
upon my word said mrs	5.387407387393333
bennet to walk to oakham mount this morning	4.877307984167527
bingley butgood lord	5.172998707085184
darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount and elizabeth silently consented	6.930144007624899
gardiners long letter but now having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as follows i would have thanked you before my dear aunt as i ought to have done for your long kind satisfactory detail of particulars but to say the truth i was too cross to write	7.158642196824272
bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr	5.147724880059296
the pain of separation however might be alleviated on his side by preparations for the reception of his bride as he had reason to hope that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men	7.147628275459496
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here collected in one individual	5.286299839577446
NUM e NUM	4.114467713750011
can you deny that you have done it she repeated	8.890932313361667
his understanding and opinions all please me he wants nothing but a little more liveliness and that if he marry prudently his wife may teach him	5.705301182698841
collinss present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter to whom they could give little fortune and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair	5.957680429876333
a most delightful place excellent parsonage house	5.1589319274321985
and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement i will make no promise of the kind miss bennet i am shocked and astonished	7.776994943583599
they then went away	6.227865829874439
this will not do said elizabeth	9.110725426588445
to carolines assertion of her brothers being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit	6.340472102518434
she could not bear such suspense and hastily seizing a sheet of paper wrote a short letter to her aunt to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended	5.5024791011747896
let us hope therefore that her being there may teach her her own insignificance	6.73317857984969
but this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differently affected when to her utter amazement she saw mr	6.648084919783281
bingley she added for when you went to town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned	7.240378157592733
darcy was really the object of her choice by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day but had stood the test of many months suspense and enumerating with energy all his good qualities she did conquer her fathers incredulity and reconcile him to the match	5.585630789595638
lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before how many years longer mr	5.187622259591715
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs	4.7748714653246
could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts	8.387630963978182
jamess sir william was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow and take his seat without saying a word and his daughter frightened almost out of her senses sat on the edge of her chair not knowing which way to look	7.095579309389019
i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here	6.278214771863913
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy	6.125754481194109
darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire paid his compliments with his usual reserve to mrs	6.367046914115009
she has a very good notion of fingering though her taste is not equal to annes	6.364761719493823
if i wished to think slightingly of any bodys children it should not be of my own however if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it yesbut as it happens they are all of them very clever this is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree	8.306524641552942
there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again therefore stay quietly at longbourn and depend on my diligence and care	7.059911281245164
they contained no actual complaint nor was there any revival of past occurrences or any communication of present suffering	3.64822289681898
bennet could hardly contain herself	5.812640081506017
you must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of believing what i say	6.056191932012609
collins moreover adds i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydias sad business has been so well hushed up and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known	6.144060849981568
gardiners hope of lydias being soon married her joy burst forth and every following sentence added to its exuberance	5.030199928510639
i cannot find out that i hate her at all or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl	9.49016091755837
if you do not choose to understand me forgive my impertinence	5.50914789808998
and what sort of table do they keep	5.761044017588875
she was engaged one day as she walked in reperusing janes last letter and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits when instead of being again surprised by mr	5.486330801557812
your father was gone your uncle at home and as i said before they had a great deal of talk together	9.19594617881869
bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared darcy was continually giving offence	5.5371370972989515
is it true elizabeth replied that it was	7.806101241853346
wickham began to speak on more general topics meryton the neighbourhood the society appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen and speaking of the latter especially with gentle but very intelligible gallantry	5.530722661920442
whilst wandering on in this slow manner they were again surprised and elizabeths astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of mr	7.417279833413828
jonestherefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to meand excepting a sorethroat and headache there is not much the matter with me	7.661144215659797
shall we ask him why a man of sense and education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers i can answer your question said fitzwilliam without applying to him	5.54825746022135
it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy	7.832351545769219
but our visitor was very obstinate	6.214730394396072
if you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this agreement you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of project gutenbergtm electronic works in your possession	4.848867659289568
i do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain	6.422643663448936
gardiner had hurried back in alarm supposing by the servants account that their niece was taken suddenly illbut satisfying them instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy though lydia had never been a favourite with them mr	5.1404566847604665
hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument how frequently mr	6.009072488654572

bennet before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter let us come to a right understanding	6.100691850583551
i should never have said mrs	6.303236985356242
my faults according to this calculation are heavy indeed	4.693239361214533
darcy invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport	6.046128938874077

elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt	7.286879991749235
collinss joints of meat were too large for her family	4.766926684479821
do let me ask my partner to introduce you which do you mean and turning round he looked for a moment at elizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly said she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men	5.816112059558574
you began the evening well charlotte said mrs	6.023529271252712
i was only confused for the moment because i felt that i should be looked at	10.235670491088982
miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other	6.701001775551568
philips and she ventured without any permission to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton	9.014127570964428
were it known to the rest of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express i am sorry exceedingly sorry replied darcy in a tone of surprise and emotion that you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken light have given you uneasiness	7.602452976429275
her carriage remained at the door and elizabeth saw that her waitingwoman was in it	8.526150072711115
when they repaired to the diningroom elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place which in all their former parties had belonged to him by her sister	7.301557511834255
i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr	7.082044368781638
your affectionate friend lydia bennet oh	4.9667193357699375
you are not going to be missish i hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report	7.169811163620516
darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand that without knowing what she did she accepted him	8.258703492318823
not at all	6.915293321380329
darcy improves on acquaintance indeed cried wickham with a look which did not escape her	5.768839377033008

bennet he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon	4.612008929806655

his own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events mr	6.193232662447708
something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life	10.281010847165755
jane listened with astonishment and concernshe knew not how to believe that mr	5.717843033685111
what do i not owe you	5.337496416619659
and so is it quite certain he is coming you may depend on it replied the other for mrs	7.688242424115881
this was one point with regard to lydia at least which was now to be settled and mr	8.380928797347794
darcy whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident	5.430264546287929
that had his actions been what wickham represented them so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as mr	6.805639301660133
and so i suppose they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead	6.55096518030333
i hoped to find you reasonable but depend upon it i will carry my point in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of the carriage when turning hastily round she added i take no leave of you miss bennet	6.888701959188223

collinss return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs	6.1274308547822045
darcys looks and behaviour	6.095495381978703
all was acknowledged and half the night spent in conversation	6.570211061791731
when i consider she added in a yet more agitated voice that i might have prevented it i who knew what he was	8.738864388908759
at least you should not remind your mother of inviting him as i did the other day said elizabeth with a conscious smile very true it will be wise in me to refrain from that	8.167105061200848
and his answering immediately to the last questionoh	8.494970732159906
collins and me have a little conversation together elizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty followed but lydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could and charlotte detained first by the civility of mr	6.442788159655537
janes temper was not desponding and she was gradually led to hope though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart	7.2526855830509085
they will have nothing else to do mr	8.953658364346543
do any thing rather than marry without affection	6.398134183915158
bingley said her mother i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on mr	6.466950055424536
his air was grave and stately and his manners were very formal	6.957840512880234
darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam the younger son of his uncle lord and to the great surprise of all the party when mr	8.554041182054922
but does not jane correspond with the sister	8.399025313897742
yours c well my dear said mr	5.446874009617614
there are few people whom i really love and still fewer of whom i think well	7.003313984792306
a few weeks he believed	7.420737998152239
lord how ashamed i should be of not being married before three and twenty	6.151196835310022
what are you telling miss bennet	6.879863076507175
bennet coolly observed from all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must be two of the silliest girls in the country	8.203447850736069
the morrow produced no abatement of mrs	3.7790162220786083
how shall we punish him for such a speech nothing so easy if you have but the inclination said elizabeth	7.503844029119304
she respected she esteemed she was grateful to him she felt a real interest in his welfare and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power which her fancy told her she still possessed of bringing on the renewal of his addresses	8.156852660863931
that he has neither integrity nor honour	6.511938679134959
i must ask whether you were surprised said elizabeth	6.303046687495294
i have a high respect for your nerves	6.771034515128352
one morning soon after their arrival as she was sitting with her two elder sisters she said to elizabeth lizzy i never gave you an account of my wedding i believe	8.434396380568378
we neither of us perform to strangers here they were interrupted by lady catherine who called out to know what they were talking of	6.790574054049068
to pemberley therefore they were to go	7.4595895797285525
collins all praise of me will be unnecessary	7.770927603556929
as a brother a landlord a master she considered how many peoples happiness were in his guardianship how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow how much of good or evil must be done by him	7.111536227045267
after making every possible enquiry on that side london colonel f	5.025860613205862
her nose wants character there is nothing marked in its lines	5.324595192287283
she was sure they should be married some time or other and it did not much signify when	9.274290192845466
darcy drew his chair a little towards her and said you cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment	7.883599945074595
whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with composure	10.182974928128434
if elizabeth when mr	6.226026613640259
bennets sour looks and illnatured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away	5.41385697252891
i almost envy you the pleasure and yet i believe it would be too much for me or else i could take it in my way to newcastle	8.799624234409519
reynolds anticipated miss darcys delight when she should enter the room	6.100442544679747
he then said i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly	7.111373597369888
she will follow wherever lydia leads	4.820615881007129
elizabeth hoped she had silenced him but he soon afterwards said i was surprised to see darcy in town last month	9.360159978991906
her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice you observed it mr	3.3497368236353617
elizabeths spirits soon rising to playfulness again she wanted mr	4.313048143054527
the subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner but it was now a good deal counteracted by the selfconceit of a weak head living in retirement and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity	6.020003677887387
so tall oh my dear lizzy	6.016896762019834
bennet and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you mrs	8.243959898619051
they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she distinguished no part of the scene	7.2700762628422035
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is	5.727123771028343
bennet could hardly comprehend it	5.595098864803673
they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions and i find that the young man forgot to tell you among his other communications that he was the son of old wickham the late mr	6.990573959591329
who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival i am the less surprised at what has happened replied sir william from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire	5.722151291668382
as for my fair cousins though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting my cousin elizabeth with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return	5.222929759583878
what a stroke was this for poor jane	4.65330073436341
at length however his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the health of her family	6.917024151868213
wherever you and jane are known you must be respected and valued and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple ofor i may say three very silly sisters	5.914160424065672
i see your design bingley said his friend you dislike an argument and want to silence this perhaps i do	5.509122252900488
it was then disclosed in the following manner	8.422033011853825
miss bennet accepted her aunts invitation with pleasure and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time than as she hoped that by carolines not living in the same house with her brother she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of seeing him	8.157083009050242
she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means	5.475626840187415
she had always seen it with pain but respecting his abilities and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children was so highly reprehensible	6.324431019809345
miss bingley was engrossed by mr	5.580224033605601
her hopes were answered jane had not been gone long before it rained hard	5.4601667807546885
collins who entered with an air more stately than usual and on perceiving whom she said to the girls now i do insist upon it that you all of you hold your tongues and let mr	7.645327470271288
he really believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he should be in some danger	11.089189344980927
but she had no reason to fear mr	6.6017194184788375
sir william how can you tell such a story do not you know that mr	8.852605907763287
collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking replied thus my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdomprovided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained	6.041303966288852
it was reasonable however to hope that they would not continue long	8.19773329845746
when darcy returned to the saloon miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister	8.805928848048822
i have been a selfish being all my life in practice though not in principle	6.4042350248934605
we have heard nothing from town dear madam cried mrs	5.249826362914399
he meant to provide for me amply and thought he had done it but when the living fell it was given elsewhere good heavens cried elizabeth but how could that be how could his will be disregarded why did not you seek legal redress there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law	7.170920810039069
they found mr	5.931792968757706
both changed colour one looked white the other red	5.354606261970748
elizabeth as they drove along watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation and when at length they turned in at the lodge her spirits were in a high flutter	6.975642357988801
and her calling here was prodigiously civil	6.137342195216584
if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may be the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning	7.384641141274132
mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given her application it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached	5.083965511736913
has she any family she has one only daughter the heiress of rosings and of very extensive property ah cried mrs	4.677935120128853
darcys but you shall do as you chuse it was some time however before a smile could be extorted from jane	7.704251261558673
my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my manner has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologise chapter xxi	6.3818072575187355
the quiet the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness	7.038742011666953
she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas	8.131740923811321
bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth	6.681961426094782
but make a virtue of it by all means	7.482342802775797
he has been here this half hour and master has had a letter away ran the girls too eager to get in to have time for speech	6.158737701182629
but lizzy this must go no farther than yourself or jane at most	4.95022966238537
every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world and every body began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness	8.54368723389592
i have suspected it some time but i am now convinced catherine was disconcerted and made no answer but lydia with perfect indifference continued to express her admiration of captain carter and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day as he was going the next morning to london	6.836088913678238
she had never seen a place for which nature had done more or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste	5.5590490503466805
it is excellent news capital news and about a certain person that we all like jane and elizabeth looked at each other and the waiter was told that he need not stay	7.20311858846169
my dear dear lydia she cried this is delightful indeed she will be married i shall see her again she will be married at sixteen my good kind brother i knew how it would bei knew he would manage every thing	7.159449056221333
darcy repeated elizabeth in utter amazement	5.244826359625087
it was some days however before they received any invitation thither for while there were visitors in the house they could not be necessary and it was not till easterday almost a week after the gentlemens arrival that they were honoured by such an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening	6.522677177523064
collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement	7.938687783572292
it was all pride and insolence	6.5545407086732
pray make haste and come into the diningroom for there is such a sight to be seen	8.418043350542296
collins was to attend them at the request of mr	6.818012902046667
the person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund	4.3617388276610525
therei have saved you the trouble of accounting for it and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly reasonable	5.659241314979316
to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh	5.892329773704507
it seemed like wilful illnature or a voluntary penance for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her	5.825125712134641
the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary nothing therefore could be fairly conjectured from that though elizabeth who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings was perfectly aware that had she known nothing of darcy she could have borne the dread of lydias infamy somewhat better	7.460176652387974
wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers who in comparison with the stranger were become stupid disagreeable fellows some of them were to dine with the philipses the next day and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr	6.16178288064548
promise me therefore to come to hunsford elizabeth could not refuse though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit	7.582855150728669

how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to say you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly i must not decide on my own performance he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton	8.389273881823144

she will be down in a moment i dare say he then shut the door and coming up to her claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister	7.764371632583645
bennet was mindful of her intended civility and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time	7.016973529960856
you must come and make lizzy marry mr	5.682647776773408
federal laws and your states laws	5.173247328580121
all loveliness and goodness as she is	7.51056292685601
she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight and was certain of a willing listener in jane whenever she might wish to talk again of either	8.10885976404715
no no this is not likely	9.246494837955888
collins is a conceited pompous narrowminded silly man you know he is as well as i do and you must feel as well as i do that the woman who marries him cannot have a proper way of thinking	7.6937206874235855
let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor this was not very consoling to mrs	7.266621330157931
darcy is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light	7.5467589880706125
she saw all the glories of the camp its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines crowded with the young and the gay and dazzling with scarlet and to complete the view she saw herself seated beneath a tent tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once	4.412276980432305
i must beg to return to the house and she rose as she spoke	9.684070397652414
his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth requiring no partner in his pleasure	6.867483202295324
their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets and jane more especially who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself had she been the culprit was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure	6.581512170588542
the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious attention	5.5349876674226275
after a song or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always impatient for display	6.596936426651195
i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner	5.42937881046983
how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library no one made any reply	8.192172641192942
philips visited them all and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before	5.659451517784932
had she merely dined with him she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent togetherand four evenings may do a great deal yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingtun better than commerce but with respect to any other leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded well said charlotte i wish jane success with all my heart and if she were married to him tomorrow i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth	6.264559531378035
darcy by character perfectly well	5.114504673916341
collins had been taken in thirdly she trusted that they would never be happy together and fourthly that the match might be broken off	7.021342551148805
only think what an establishment it would be for one of them	7.156807422802347
you must send john with the young ladies mrs	6.510582083706123

collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers it was performed in a proper manner without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary	8.141264682468027
everything wore a happier aspect	4.081550426585534
while i can have my mornings to myself said she it is enough i think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements	7.017997876939166
collinss triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete	6.623531661780875
as for their mother mr	8.114190741561421
but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again	5.458548847326893
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious made no other reply to elizabeths salutation than a slight inclination of the head and sat down without saying a word	6.730101569243692
they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptionable purpose	6.535284184931741
bennet however with the assistance of her five daughters could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr	6.5306986000556035
bennet very dull for several days	4.640851839759363
darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my fathers active superintendance and when immediately before my fathers death mr	6.624699136261832
to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed	8.370551577307555
she could only imagine however at last that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in any other person present	6.507647207570384
sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty	6.539740940260235
i am the happiest creature in the world	5.372628566610209
i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing young women should always be properly guarded and attended according to their situation in life	5.711411089613133
lizzy why am i thus singled from my family and blessed above them all	5.494565302631046
darcy rise also and follow him and her agitation on seeing it was extreme	7.652369174068238
things are settled so oddly you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate ah	5.67614863621066
my dear niece i have just received your letter and shall devote this whole morning to answering it as i foresee that a little writing will not comprise what i have to tell you	6.665820904824108
i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well i assure you	6.2090987459030735
it was gratitude gratitude not merely for having once loved her but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection	5.465023894092508
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley and that she could not speak a word especially to miss darcy without calling her attention	7.0638868937221995
may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible mr	5.1029578477397575
never mind miss lizzys hair we will be down as soon as we can said jane but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us for she went up stairs half an hour ago oh	6.167423368621291
that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid exceeded all that she could believe possible	6.020372419089241
how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs i cannot tell but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine	6.374052507393107
but do not imagine that he is always here so often	8.338478702778291
i have certainly meant well through the whole affair	6.58408271260138
she could not think of darcys leaving kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all and agreeable as he was she did not mean to be unhappy about him	8.711687882428343
there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us	7.32783519899173
you have employed your time much better	6.627980407951072
he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world	6.505012178864311
darcy afterwards discharged	5.720484431282823
how i laughed	6.683705254442652
that is all very proper and civil i am sure said mrs	5.623990048565033
or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others you take an eager interest in that gentlemans concerns said darcy in a less tranquil tone and with a heightened colour	5.117657997526111
that they should marry small as is their chance of happiness and wretched as is his character we are forced to rejoice	6.447505622631207
the sisters on hearing this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how shocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike	6.387642097571172
you must and shall be married by a special licence	7.329057848888428
all was joy and kindness	6.445311199436663
when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the drawingroom where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared	6.725405122343288
but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brothers	7.777878916249279
i can hardly write for laughing	5.73199529099211
bennet was beyond the reach of reason and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about	5.253376231817884
i can now say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud i have seen nothing of it i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us	7.800941074881156
elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that mr	7.346607022035554
will you tell me how long you have loved him it has been coming on so gradually that i hardly know when it began	7.516952544800422

elizabeth had settled it that mr	6.13135804833309
this was a lucky idea of mine indeed said mrs	6.044072786135292
it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations	7.629124955154514

he now seated himself by her and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire of travelling and staying at home of new books and music that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself as well as of mr	5.459265325004411

his disposition must be dreadful i will not trust myself on the subject replied wickham i can hardly be just to him elizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaimed to treat in such a manner the godson the friend the favourite of his father she could have added a young man too like you whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable but she contented herself with and one too who had probably been his own companion from childhood connected together as i think you said in the closest manner we were born in the same parish within the same park the greatest part of our youth was passed together inmates of the same house sharing the same amusements objects of the same parental care	6.736975075291094
