this has been my motive my fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem	2.576455777928368
it was at sir william lucass where a large party were assembled	1.6931051038668632
bennet and kitty walked off and as soon as they were gone mr	2.9578112783263104
elizabeth after slightly surveying it went to a window to enjoy its prospect	1.763033961164333
not to appear to disgrace his family to degenerate from the popular qualities or lose the influence of the pemberley house is a powerful motive	1.8933183138796255
gardiners caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone after honestly telling her what she thought she thus went on you are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because you are warned against it and therefore i am not afraid of speaking openly	1.776298361910408
she is well and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother yours c	1.6409353019084056
darcy with an expression of halflaughing alarm	3.3713810204995127
his marriage was now fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an illnatured tone that she wished they might be happy thursday was to be the wedding day and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit and when she rose to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her mothers ungracious and reluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied her out of the room	1.8751135625248332
bingley returned mr	2.00869497659548
collinss letter and after laughing at her some time allowed her at last to gosaying as she quitted the room if any young men come for mary or kitty send them in for i am quite at leisure elizabeths mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight and after half an hours quiet reflection in her own room she was able to join the others with tolerable composure	1.5073554019898574
they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects	1.529063798015507
no no you shall not deceive me	2.284057372079699
philips a very attentive listener whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could	2.234855404944997
elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from pemberley	1.6250379359184872
hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves	2.0784374881961445
at length however the question was asked by her uncle and she turned away with alarm while mrs	1.5857845684381302
i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to mr	2.288643384401462
you will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one i cannot pretend to be sorry said wickham after a short interruption that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts but with him i believe it does not often happen	1.920360219883399
i roused and interested you because i was so unlike them	1.5689044527567568
she could not determine how her mother would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man	2.542632155153322
much as i abominate writing i would not give up mr	2.957862482610711
bennet give up the point	1.5726931539986229
happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance	1.0841027370961147
there was no help for it however	3.3179036867768934
and then when you go away you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over i thank you for my share of the favour said elizabeth but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them	1.8269523184685854
you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night	2.0565986819893824
i hope added mrs	2.7132439811388602
gardiner i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body as he has done by poor wickham	2.485019966296861
her mother stepped forwards embraced her and welcomed her with rapture gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham who followed his lady and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness	1.5506886385260872
but when she read and reread with the closest attention the particulars immediately following of wickhams resigning all pretensions to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate	1.7890732009876722
it is unaccountable	6.142224972697517
bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproof nothing is more deceitful said darcy than the appearance of humility	1.6342613088099245
you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper	2.1659737950253213
sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine what think you of books said he smiling	1.705932396081972
lydias going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husbands never intending to go there himself	2.5497484778171073
darcy to be treating his fathers favourite in such a manner one whom his father had promised to provide for it is impossible	2.300282802370121
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as elizabeth half expected mr	1.8789107554692044
long said miss lucas but i wish he had danced with eliza another time lizzy said her mother i would not dance with him if i were you i believe maam i may safely promise you never to dance with him his pride said miss lucas does not offend me so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for it	2.1103276302976473
darcy and herself	4.673446222801967
if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand it does not advance their felicity in the least	1.6947488985367456
darcys pleasure in the bingleys invitation to the officers and though this was not exactly the case the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr	3.4708927030193615
no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrasseda resolution the more necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room	1.9548001449546832
you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him	3.1483985079517067
the carriage was sent to meet them at and they were to return in it by dinnertime	1.6717321626916093
it was really a very handsome thought	6.460372569483476
what a meeting for her when she first sees my aunt we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side said jane i hope and trust they will yet be happy	1.6925570356534956
darcy will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right	1.9959215600279003

gardiners behaviour laid them all under	2.164766295238619
you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the young people	3.1166306271464386
it was first broken by mrs	1.6482394707416077
when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject	1.6835525423941835
her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where mr	1.7360092965624536
i found said he as the time drew near that i had better not meet mr	1.7239028243071002
well well i only hope it will last	2.695968632589441
elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it	2.5436251209313343
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife was exactly what he had wished for and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady catherines condescension as he knew not how to admire enough	1.483195280569481
darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public	2.748291133810954
the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking mr	1.9416243243308313
her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious as bingley had now been gone a week and nothing was heard of his return	1.700283415291214
i know not miss elizabeth said he whether mrs	1.9242654896659466
when jane and elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautious in her praise of mr	2.3317487798764827
i have faults enough but they are not i hope of understanding	1.8405679830052066
there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention while she added when i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement but that from knowing him better his disposition was better understood wickhams alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look for a few minutes he was silent till shaking off his embarrassment he turned to her again and said in the gentlest of accents you who so well know my feelings towards mr	1.6195267200522603
oh lydia i comfort myself with thinking replied jane that he certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her	2.5918721724232787
i believe him to be lady catherines nephew	5.436766223032742
till the next morning however she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance	3.131190664495082
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat cake and a variety of all the finest fruits in season but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs	1.3229893219258895
i dare say the lace upon mrs	2.316727299822741
and above all things keep mr	1.775650673233871
well if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own so much the better	1.6664519452130286
but really and upon my honour i will try to do what i think to be wisest and now i hope you are satisfied her aunt assured her that she was and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints they parted a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented	2.2763281969764995
i do not know when i have been more shocked said she	3.657540806862122
will you be very angry with me my dear lizzy if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold enough to say before how much i like him	1.9888446596994733
imprudent as a marriage between mr	1.0704403123309147
at any rate she cannot grow many degrees worse without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content but her own opinion continued the same and she left him disappointed and sorry	1.7647997143823397
bingleys heart were entertained	2.569881750160422

she attracted him more than he likedand miss bingley was uncivil to her and more teazing than usual to himself	2.0623496197788067
i am very glad to hear such a good account of her said lady catherine and pray tell her from me that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practise a great deal i assure you madam he replied that she does not need such advice	1.9764002307549997
i should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship ten thousand pounds	4.27243307858547
bingley had danced with her twice and she had been distinguished by his sisters	2.9788140833845937
it was the prospect of constant society and good society he added which was my chief inducement to enter the shire	1.6756209785569989
what could become of mr	2.353696038011938
she then joined them soon enough to see lydia with anxious parade walk up to her mothers right hand and hear her say to her eldest sister ah	2.1719096492228656
a man of honour could not have doubted the intention but mr	2.2121308100625776

bennet as she entered the room we have had a most delightful evening a most excellent ball	3.1210246048554326
but if we do not venture somebody else will and after all mrs	2.0760996499749087
a person may be proud without being vain	1.6492077234624096
elizabeth for the sake of saying something that might turn her mothers thoughts now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away	1.6283156249730193
darcy so bad as thisthough i have never liked him i had not thought so very ill of himi had supposed him to be despising his fellowcreatures in general but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity as this after a few minutes reflection however she continued i do remember his boasting one day at netherfield of the implacability of his resentments of his having an unforgiving temper	1.660078064507598
but while he was mortal there must be a triumph	1.7298389711551974
bennet one communication would therefore do for all	1.4425762953863814
from the entrance hall of which mr	2.064974722304479
bennet was not in the habit of walking mary could never spare time but the remaining five set off together	2.149757160386437
bingley her sisters being in town	2.075135839115667
we do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance	2.5912902628966705
morris immediately that he is to take possession before michaelmas and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week what is his name bingley is he married or single oh	1.7929615895325421
unless the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped	1.9234515831733412
reflection must be reserved for solitary hours whenever she was alone she gave way to it as the greatest relief and not a day went by without a solitary walk in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections	1.6555385381890655
thoughtlessness want of attention to other peoples feelings and want of resolution will do the business and do you impute it to either of those yes to the last	1.6167079964876128
of the ladys sensations they remained a little in doubt but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough	1.4712694070160497
darcy took her advice and did finish his letter	2.7465904295661936
his character sunk on every review of it and as a punishment for him as well as a possible advantage to jane she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr	1.936921717445207
he owed a good deal in the town but his debts of honour were still more formidable	1.3188347917871428
he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity sensible that if such an idea had been suggested his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it	1.4919067522729195
you have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew	2.1834357660931625
but perhaps he could not in her mothers presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt	3.2235959401062817
see URL or URL URL or URL images of the original pages are available through internet archive	1.8205845163694858
she was ashamed to think how much	2.6361005939123965
if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course	1.607779313578005
darcy was punctual in his return and as lydia informed you attended the wedding	1.510531420306673
his being such a charming young man and so rich and living but three miles from them were the first points of selfgratulation and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do	2.435900640378816
darcy in wretched suspense could only say something indistinctly of his concern and observe her in compassionate silence	2.0992369317485986
he arranges the business just as he pleases and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice	1.9369230280467844
hurst began again	2.332731106405929
they descended the hill crossed the bridge and drove to the door and while examining the nearer aspect of the house all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned	1.5310568430707538
the country is a vast deal pleasanter is not it mr	1.6774240188305616
for my part i am inclined to believe it all mr	3.6537222841383477
she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia and removed from the influence of lydias example she became by proper attention and management less irritable less ignorant and less insipid	1.7521968323864368
bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield	2.499368432340836
she was more alive to the disgrace which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughters nuptials than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they took place	1.832948788601335
yesit would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again	1.4271634161783522
he sat with them above an hour and was in remarkably good spirits	2.370232738788576
darcy can please where he chuses	1.5211157896433602
darcys sister as by wickhams account she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away	1.4565305751381326
i am not qualified to form one	1.8243905660297408
wickhams intention to go into the regulars and among his former friends there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army	1.66872515234271
bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner and then added may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr	1.487066377633138
an airing would do me a great deal of good i am sure	2.49457271680656
will you come and see me we shall often meet i hope in hertfordshire i am not likely to leave kent for some time	2.0908119420295592
she looked at jane and smiled and shook her head by turns	2.522179217283931
one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight	2.8104349421900214

colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon	2.450123046552619
charlotte is an excellent manager i dare say	2.067419982260139
darcys next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in gracechurchstreet the evening before i came home	2.2528730800274803
but i can assure you she added that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not at all worth pleasing	1.6435046840658936
the officer was the very mr	1.5136609681988744
after sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view mr	2.4816645267498934
i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner	2.7944804603560254
he could number the fields in every direction and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump	1.854884953251607
with no greater events than these in the longbourn family and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton sometimes dirty and sometimes cold did january and february pass away	1.7504641051478902
he added that mr	1.6677022056275423
lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephews letter that charlotte really rejoicing in the match was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over	1.4959224127240596
under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief	1.6475417684012046
bennet as soon as they were out of the house as ever i saw	3.750835190749443
are you going much farther no i should have turned in a moment and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonage together	2.3504657025688447
darcy as much as i ever wish to be cried elizabeth warmly i have spent four days in the same house with him and i think him very disagreeable i have no right to give my opinion said wickham as to his being agreeable or otherwise	2.3041541504913674
and this said she is the end of all his friends anxious circumspection	3.9623630443970637
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forsters	2.1372994379035077
but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant	1.7936176056259236
though her manner varied however her determination never did	2.3488315649469236
their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party i assure you i feel it exceedingly said lady catherine i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do	2.1277900601616304
wickham and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr	1.9916530251872786
darcy and you yourself when last at longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him	1.797718743428009
before any answer could arrive from mr	1.0740897666593001
bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him myself how can you be so teazing i honour your circumspection	1.8549426255547674
but are you pleased jane	2.215941930605751
i must find mr	2.5447543020434877
she wrote cheerfully seemed surrounded with comforts and mentioned nothing which she could not praise	1.7312067854646416
bennet replied his wife how can you be so tiresome	2.94022299535328
good gracious cried mrs	4.038113308261384
we now come to the point	3.462673625904626
we dine at rosings twice every week and are never allowed to walk home	1.426911252825582
bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle i should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers elizabeth made no answer	1.9835525475168372
her many attractions were again dwelt on and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter	1.236795778677871
collins for she vows she will not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her mr	2.343047781185219
but no letter appeared and she was completely puzzled	1.997726620056262
at length the parsonage was discernible	3.0776778754536624
to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town or as the happiest alternative been secluded from the world in some distant farm house	2.339039083025651
lizzy my dear run down to your father and ask him how much he will give her	2.0838374128427715
it was in the times and the courier i know though it was not put in as it ought to be	2.269378985180616
how wonderfully these sort of things occur	1.6734042189054594
i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit	1.4475826806151364
bingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at longbourn coming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till after supper unless when some barbarous neighbour who could not be enough detested had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept	1.6347200188172208
i think she will be pleased with the hermitage elizabeth obeyed and running into her own room for her parasol attended her noble guest down stairs	2.390882446063907
if she does not object to it why should we her not objecting does not justify him	2.211398364776864
i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier	1.7143063462873542
give me farther particulars	4.718203022764475
you mentioned two instances	1.775637970332471
and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs	3.325022770219879
lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed	1.4942826534882645
i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned mr	1.9163459021590223
as they walked across the lawn towards the river elizabeth turned back to look again her uncle and aunt stopped also and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables	1.3890151243857654
but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr	1.8697268392335906
my dear dear jane i am so happy	5.420534333765387
bingley himself elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied before mr	2.2573152460610704
collins seemed neither in need of encouragement nor inclined to be silent himself	2.733670920340934
i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you it is evident by this added jane that he comes back no more this winter it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should why will you think so	1.8811746832778495
from something that he told me in our journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him	2.736789489600255
collins in describing the civility of mr	3.060083022921486
is there nothing you could take to give you present relief a glass of wineshall i get you one you are very ill no i thank you she replied endeavouring to recover herself	1.836870794855092
this invaluable friend was a very young woman and very lately married	1.7171579658139862
but before she had been three minutes in her own room her mother followed her	3.0098773015841664
her aunt asked her smilingly how she liked it	2.2300883764607002
he does not want abilities	1.6019255011721503
gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power elizabeth though expecting no less thanked him with tears of gratitude and all three being actuated by one spirit every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled	1.3781532424906515
you may convert to and distribute this work in any binary compressed marked up nonproprietary or proprietary form including any word processing or hypertext form	1.634012395209092
can i speak plainer	2.8651567763722725
elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could	3.2918769331139313
i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony	2.2874625984437054
every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane	2.2569494387973696
but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render mr	2.0296116468592773
wickham who left the place immediately and mrs	1.5802087883584626
very well that reply will do for the present perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones but now we may be silent do you talk by rule then while you are dancing sometimes	1.6751805380766003
he did trace them easily to clapham but no farther for on entering that place they removed into a hackneycoach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom	1.3861852035109923
she had never heard of his having had any relations except a father and mother both of whom had been dead many years	2.094488516570649
bingley comes my dear said mrs	2.7859872299645128
their other aunt also visited them frequently and always as she said with the design of cheering and heartening them up though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickhams extravagance or irregularity she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them	1.439323654799761
till i was in kent and saw so much both of mr	2.0926909024726883
she was wild to be at hometo hear to see to be upon the spot to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her in a family so deranged a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and requiring constant attendance and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia her uncles interference seemed of the utmost importance and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience was severe	1.3613826263587696
a ladys imagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to love from love to matrimony in a moment	1.5323940216737824
its windows opening to the ground admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn	1.5948993334708728
she was a woman of mean understanding little information and uncertain temper	1.749065066884671
by elizabeths instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself	1.6934545619033747
what is the matter cried he with more feeling than politeness then recollecting himself i will not detain you a minute but let me or let the servant go after mr	1.5920771523819195
the latter was thinking only of his breakfast	3.284173149527772
so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper or her affectionate heart	1.7025584985330873
but it is fortunate thought she that i have something to wish for	3.369323241534702
yesif darcy does not put it off again	1.147139714056658
since her being at lambton she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy	2.399500477851628
he was always to have gone on saturday and to saturday he still meant to stay	2.0399585330546155
where does discretion end and avarice begin	2.212149640959709
a military life is not what i was intended for but circumstances have now made it eligible	1.378656605081964
i hope he will overlook it	2.2233720668159576
you must write again very soon and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last	2.7089435028375295
theres for you	1.2126109132185743
but it is so strange yesthat is what makes it amusing	1.8111069366932318
the dinner was exceedingly handsome and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which mr	1.6871755677467983
the other is miss de bourgh	2.826838841011652
had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his affection every moment more valuable	1.6102522676003417
nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the united states	2.794327797477419
bennet and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman	4.43362602392241
as soon as they had driven from the door elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings which for charlottes sake she made more favourable than it really was	2.2328244317123564
bingley not at all he is a sweet tempered amiable charming man	2.1738265248145145
gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces	2.2129333127622473
gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found elizabeths arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred her husbands	2.369255349698377
you dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse	1.4860487034088468
i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield	2.7463247048306347
the possibility of meeting mr	3.2236067330699574
one days delay she observed would be of small importance and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual	2.6553581120885954
i now give it to you if you are resolved on having him	1.9908692686493021
collins my dear madam replied he let us be for ever silent on this point	2.1780842277189345
gardiner mr	2.4130123664522505
you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite	1.5560068017047717
the evening passed quietly unmarked by any thing extraordinary	2.55329571060574
if i had ever learnt i should have been a great proficient	3.150248170960215
there is not a bit of fish to be got today	2.913253039851314
this was agreed to and mrs	2.0274191528014636
i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had yes he introduced us to his sister and do you like her very much i have heard indeed that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two	2.129298688964017
as they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different positions but from every window there were beauties to be seen	1.9983597123512216
you write uncommonly fast you are mistaken	2.205606266742018
darcy a most intimate confidential friend	1.5211157896433602
bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible advice which there was every reason to believe would be attended to and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard	1.6814131356325688
but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was	3.0760452137477303
my father bears it better	2.449137352639312
you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope though you have but a short lease whatever i do is done in a hurry replied he and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five minutes	2.184167532851634
you know i always speak my mind and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves	2.684580376682533
every thing was too recent for gaiety but the evening passed tranquilly away there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time	1.6813968950321774
tis an etiquette i despise said he	3.24673932827217
her father contented with laughing at them would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters and her mother with manners so far from right herself was entirely insensible of the evil	1.3890152117626857
you may imagine what i felt and how i acted	2.225763234989957
she could think only of her letter	2.944947892781628
we have reason to imagine that his aunt lady catherine de bourgh does not look on the match with a friendly eye mr	1.6572845217502659
could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster	2.534059509030768
be assured my dear sir that mrs	3.4070149824628637
i have no such injuries to resent	2.1424330963531437
it only shews her being deficient in something herselfsense or feeling well cried elizabeth have it as you choose	1.4662807335990347
what could be more natural than his asking you again	2.5583839702267857
the express was sent off directly	1.6529543392465451
bennet himself while his wife seriously commended mr	1.4425762953863814
you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling i am sure you did	2.7340940343457736
donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks online payments and credit card donations	1.0906668957545287
they then sat down and when her enquiries after rosings were made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence	2.408367851551076
darcy had considerable patronage in the church and his cousin could have none at all	2.8674139811585255
she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country	2.277415850028073
it was very little less	3.359005314162589
there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs	3.1425664669547966
if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection elizabeths change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty	1.4130426639140727
as for your elizabeths picture you must not attempt to have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their colour and shape and the eyelashes so remarkably fine might be copied at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs	1.6047987605672551
wickham himself no he never saw him till the other morning at meryton this account then is what he has received from mr	1.5139553986913534
we shall be at newcastle all the winter and i dare say there will be some balls and i will take care to get good partners for them all i should like it beyond any thing said her mother	2.507194685036206
any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she understood he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield and she blushed as she answered i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family	1.67076984349794
is not general incivility the very essence of love oh yes of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt	1.8139511985463557
as yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness	1.5032340413330767
it amazes me i confessfor certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction	1.8817193277207462
if he wishes to avoid seeing me he must go	2.257045688190974
why any fear of detection	2.1231896969794
vain ignorant idle and absolutely uncontrouled	3.4190278449281
her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable and could she have included jane in the scheme every part of it would have been perfect	2.1127469793336267
when dinner was over she returned directly to jane and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room	2.107279196669066
she wrote even to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her former professions of regard	1.6203554829212032
and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother said mr	1.9364422508496284
he heard her with astonishment	7.544714344007678
bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do	1.8476202079456094
between the two eldest and herself especially there subsisted a very particular regard	2.6180636007619698
bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity	1.8600609188340316
he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce	1.494388518467559
information about donations to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation project gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment	1.5328816499029745
you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert	1.6041959007208353
i rather expected from my knowledge of her affability that it would happen	2.2502379254538485
she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened it was impossible to think of any thing else and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise	1.8093153581352373
i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance	2.1606452095596294
she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it but she could no longer be blind to miss bingleys inattention	2.8165105626345404
i will only add god bless you	1.9552091662814621
i should say one of her ladyships carriages for she has several lady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed added charlotte and a most attentive neighbour very true my dear that is exactly what i say	2.6849757373134486
and pray what sort of guardians do you make	2.3997063348905883
he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them but he had something to direct his search which was more than we had and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us	2.0821317718362664
i rather wonder now at your knowing any are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this i never saw such a woman	2.039295358050888
till this moment i never knew myself from herself to janefrom jane to bingley her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr	1.5180521448091375
mary was the only daughter who remained at home and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs	2.0819195960061476
it was agreed to	4.945609178765086
he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to any one else	3.9113093975252298
the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a skreen	1.3087611610421048
we dressed up chamberlayne in womans clothes on purpose to pass for a lady only think what fun	1.3935815327848022
gardiner and miss bennet to dinner at pemberley before they left the country	2.9779842191644446
he addressed himself directly to miss bennet with a polite congratulation mr	1.7608837098883674
she was no sooner in possession of it than hurrying into the little copse where she was least likely to be interrupted she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial	1.7819039014559521
bennet on having so fine a family of daughters said he had heard much of their beauty but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth and added that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage	2.007640111916276
indeed you must go for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not you are over scrupulous surely	3.180723555231438
the easy assurance of the young couple indeed was enough to provoke him	2.0219900246584914
have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin yes and i had heard it before	1.700173092886237
bingley i always keep servants that can do their own work my daughters are brought up differently	1.3240816806726328
she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him and turned away with a degree of ill humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr	1.8334876939514824
colonel fitzwilliams manners were very much admired at the parsonage and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings	2.244017467842995
conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible i know it cannot be long he readily assured her of his secrecyagain expressed his sorrow for her distress wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope and leaving his compliments for her relations with only one serious parting look went away	1.3456683778119094
let us hope for better things	3.369640601709214
miss darcy though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations readily obeyed	1.864823306514463
how grievous then was the thought that of a situation so desirable in every respect so replete with advantage so promising for happiness jane had been deprived by the folly and indecorum of her own family	1.8089198864173988
she declared her resolution	1.6273810802078938
how rich and how great you will be	2.393291592993738
i will speak to her about it myself directly	3.054075421740278
but my dear sister though the event has proved you right do not think me obstinate if i still assert that considering what her behaviour was my confidence was as natural as your suspicion	1.5552991557378009
wickham his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited	1.9571621634758052
well mamma said she when they were all returned to the breakfast room and what do you think of my husband	2.879741397048885
wickham in and near brighton with assurances of speedy payment for which i have pledged myself	1.430880632610001
the tumult of her mind was now painfully great	2.4042138126162333
but she would not be secure	5.420758029722128
i do not like to boast of my own child but to be sure janeone does not often see any body better looking	2.080940514783391
good bye she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of being at home again in a day or two	2.1923002411388435
younge was he knew intimately acquainted with wickham and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town	2.582166323915966
as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce	1.7888223601599333
are the others coming out i do not know	2.464213434449199
i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun my beauty you had early withstood and as for my mannersmy behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not	2.094880381345386
while settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself who had once before called late in the evening and might now come to enquire particularly after her	1.9545398561509448
you have insulted me in every possible method	2.6830779122692348
do you certainly leave kent on saturday said she	2.1188036005355855
take your choice but you must be satisfied with only one	1.3594886203939591
darcys progress through his book as in reading her own and she was perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page	1.713122213600944
elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters reflecting on what she had heard and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it when sir william lucas himself appeared sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family	2.4516931063328773
i knew said he that what i wrote must give you pain but it was necessary	2.205420296002016
every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter and in farther justification of mr	1.6848677935001457
the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickhams worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him	1.5500815308111013
i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being	1.49545271366985
darcy then was	5.1780774150716145
you supposed more than really existed	1.5988086209558732
to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds in the NUM per cents	1.7347864151380665
in essentials i believe he is very much what he ever was while she spoke wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning	1.6502803208426755
you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper	1.7397669223073475
i have not forgot you see and i assure you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement bingley looked a little silly at this reflection and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business	2.0659072570800956
unfortunately an only son for many years an only child i was spoilt by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own	1.3841224605365385
to the civil enquiries which then poured in and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr	1.7823247061258833
yours c this letter gave elizabeth some pain but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped by the sister at least	2.3199668267052105
as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family the ceremony of leavetaking was performed when the ladies moved for the night and mrs	2.0676940449059895

since such were her feelings it only remained he thought to secure and expedite a marriage which in his very first conversation with wickham he easily learnt had never been his design	1.443043864608206
he did not leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business	2.0529725905550715

your great men often are and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing as he might change his mind another day and warn me off his grounds elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character but said nothing	1.491943692430758
she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in silence on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree for in darcys breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against another	1.5002546095744396

last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me because it would be imprudent and now because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is mercenary if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is i shall know what to think she is a very good kind of girl i believe	2.088518960665997
bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets her that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth but it will not do for us	1.901104499281722

collins was settled near her family it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire	2.3402200598090195
they may wish many things besides his happiness they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money great connections and pride beyond a doubt they do wish him to chuse miss darcy replied jane but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing	1.3808737250627063

jane who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth soon lagged behind while her sister panting for breath came up with him and eagerly cried out oh papa what news	1.9203109160567262
it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection could do	1.6682979319198028
collins had promised and as he had likewise foretold he took his seat at the bottom of the table by her ladyships desire and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater he carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity and every dish was commended first by him and then by sir william who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear	1.7889260443389108
darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body went away	1.449524330206687

bennet as much as possible saying not much to elizabeth and nothing at all to the others	3.147489586758501
bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem	1.7801298261538878
his surprise was great	1.9036698503363505
it was a handsome modern building well situated on rising ground	1.570636050081466
collins and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyships praise into his own hands	1.7335066536524126
remember that she is one of a large family that as to fortune it is a most eligible match and be ready to believe for every bodys sake that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin to oblige you i would try to believe almost any thing but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him i should only think worse of her understanding than i now do of her heart	1.7089453919188033
and so extremely accomplished for her age	1.936508312420019
it was a painful but not an improbable conjecture	1.6790340929248957
georgianas reception of them was very civil but attended with all that embarrassment which though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved	1.3910142936642287
its completion depended on others	3.1443693262140253
to jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused and whose merit she had undervalued but to her own more extensive information he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits and whom she regarded herself with an interest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just as what jane felt for bingley	2.3610658709205223
nothing could console and nothing appease her nor did that day wear out her resentment	1.6165010645288074
i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness	1.6616647679250494
she was not rendered formidable by silence but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her selfimportance and brought mr	1.4707810205673444
a place too with which so many of your acquaintance are connected	2.1460929206619572
how thankful am i that we never let them know what has been said against him we must forget it ourselves	1.3477417126947953
i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished nor i i am sure said miss bingley	2.1448353266381024
i thank you again and again for not going to the lakes	3.90324739927949
he looked serious as usual and she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as she had seen him at pemberley	4.491194912138522
the two youngest of the family catherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions their minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothing better offered a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening and however bare of news the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some from their aunt	1.6868850874963863
she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither but charlotte she soon found was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty	1.69148843877115
philips and was by her watchfulness most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin	2.251347154858003
on saturday morning elizabeth and mr	2.9222875922899902
the apothecary came and having examined his patient said as might be supposed that she had caught a violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of it advised her to return to bed and promised her some draughts	1.5293215796291717
much as i respect them i believe i thought only of you elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word	2.066112045705597
the hill crowned with wood from which they had descended receiving increased abruptness from the distance was a beautiful object	1.3882961094204198
he called it therefore his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself	1.6191023354402658
hurst and miss bingley and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it	2.455014210329036
they agreed that mrs	1.8078141178363305
after this day jane said no more of her indifference	2.875922428330254
my sister i am sure will not hear of her removal you may depend upon it madam said miss bingley with cold civility that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us mrs	1.975302188620221
i am going tomorrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him	1.6650378712407923
yet in spite of all these temptations let me warn my cousin elizabeth and yourself of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentlemans proposals which of course you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of have you any idea lizzy who this gentleman is	1.5253576240529885
i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myselffor i am fond of superior society but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas he paused in hopes of an answer but his companion was not disposed to make any and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing and called out to her my dear miss eliza why are not you dancing mr	1.7470794782261199
darcy was condemned as the worst of men	1.7975198192686197

it was all conjecture what is it you mean it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known because if it were to get round to the ladys family it would be an unpleasant thing you may depend upon my not mentioning it and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley	2.1039374929164336
my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness and in a cause of such moment as this i shall certainly not depart from it	1.9458590041807415

here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse	2.1397976567425165
he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant	1.6284483272083723
and pray may i ask but checking himself he added in a gayer tone is it in address that he improves	1.6234080185488406
philips began to express her concern thereupon he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance that he considered the money as a mere trifle and begged she would not make herself uneasy	1.6839190566528555
but still he would be her husband without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony marriage had always been her object it was the only honourable provision for welleducated young women of small fortune and however uncertain of giving happiness must be their pleasantest preservative from want	1.5230618140692096
and to be kept back on such a motive i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind upon my word said her ladyship you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person pray what is your age with three younger sisters grown up replied elizabeth smiling your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence	1.622497589002777
bennet who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him continued her triumph	2.3265599855961905
he was directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together with either of which motives his joining them would interfere	1.3965499095311216
oh sister	3.7005381355872196
well well said he do not make yourself unhappy	3.2613547565714094
bennet yes or i will never see her again an unhappy alternative is before you elizabeth	1.855864742817441
a few days after this visit mr	2.8187693519522137
maria thought speaking out of the question and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire	1.7330911898714076
gardiner could do	4.537141915290617
i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town every body was surprised and darcy after looking at her for a moment turned silently away	2.6418738825295196
she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter and without knowing or considering what their income might be rejected many as deficient in size and importance	1.2805192351895427
in this danger kitty is also comprehended	2.110244918123216
his appearance was greatly in his favour he had all the best part of beauty a fine countenance a good figure and very pleasing address	1.7060929493008157
its effect was most extraordinary for on first hearing it mrs	2.0105242806454884
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends and she could do nothing but think and think with wonder of mr	1.6942484306308732
he danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner	2.188615348079433
i can comprehend your going on charmingly when you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first place i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation	1.4538019277814882
after tea mr	2.3151103633070553
not a syllable was uttered by either and elizabeth was on the point of going away again when bingley who as well as the other had sat down suddenly rose and whispering a few words to her sister ran out of the room	2.150246834964659
sir william did not say much	6.771496647666905
when the card tables were placed he had an opportunity of obliging her in return by sitting down to whist	1.4667167004764763
gardiner though seldom able to indulge the taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man about them that he advanced but little	1.8524051016681544
this unfortunate affair will i fear prevent my sisters having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley today oh yes	1.6306849524385896
i am glad he is gone	5.624890031220751
miss bennets astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings	1.4901131165328276
she could not win him however to any conversation he merely answered her question and read on	1.5671320652746885
can it be possible that he will marry her wickham is not so undeserving then as we have thought him said her sister	3.08113686787739
she is so fond of mrs	1.7555805391227701
darcy just deigned to return	1.582667186687823
let us sit down	3.0614203823552146
the children two girls of six and eight years old and two younger boys were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane who was the general favourite and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every wayteaching them playing with them and loving them	1.4835615101873076
during dinner mr	1.0704403123309147
it was only said lately george wickham esq	2.437505498831642
bennet who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished was excessively disappointed	2.2652575578347873
bennets emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort for it gratified him he said to discover that charlotte lucas whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible was as foolish as his wife and more foolish than his daughter	1.9604211363369506
but there were two or three much uglier in the shop and when i have bought some prettiercoloured satin to trim it with fresh i think it will be very tolerable	2.3595969606190232
the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasions justifying her coming so far alone	1.327491168991021
darcy is particularly fond of that i may have it tomorrow this was a sad omen of what her mothers behaviour to the gentleman himself might be and elizabeth found that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection and secure of her relations consent there was still something to be wished for	1.78781867038083
elizabeth to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this heard it in silent indignation	1.54393971627704
darcy is all politeness said elizabeth smiling	1.7673415870260547
i should have considered it as part of my duty and the exertion would soon have been nothing	2.667505085106554
one enjoyment was certainthat of suitableness as companions a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniencescheerfulness to enhance every pleasureand affection and intelligence which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad	1.302779973392564
i came to you without a doubt of my reception	3.0778604863849894
he has given in all his debts i hope at least he has not deceived us	2.5101755736753057
and so did mrs	2.424869756678358
her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered	1.5654594730325062
but vanity not love has been my folly pleased with the preference of one and offended by the neglect of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance i have courted prepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either were concerned	1.7566074516147572
you used us abominably ill answered mrs	1.5255162326408465
i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that implies when i wrote that letter replied darcy i believed myself perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so	1.3732290007161823
implacable resentment is a shade in a character	1.147139714056658
i perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been	1.741808057498091
but it was her business to be satisfiedand certainly her temper to be happy and all was soon right again	1.796123748742477
and when we do return it shall not be like other travellers without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing	2.348995980128515
your alliance will be a disgrace your name will never even be mentioned by any of us these are heavy misfortunes replied elizabeth	2.0313392470650165
you are to understand miss bennet that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose nor will i be dissuaded from it	2.1813159729294753
the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed	1.7866119142995784
let me do it without farther loss of time	2.3411211523691144
but in matters of greater weight i may suffer from the want of money	2.4696618258668424
darcy on the contrary had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none received either attention or pleasure	1.7337047772385747
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due my object then replied darcy was to shew you by every civility in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to	1.6609355556069278
they had all been very illused since she last saw her sister	2.476466351103162
you need not send them word at longbourn of my going if you do not like it for it will make the surprise the greater when i write to them and sign my name lydia wickham	1.870951453691567
philips was an amiable intelligent elegant woman and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces	1.4592282330679684
but what does he say of the living he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard them from mr	1.8920581824212563
i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off and then i should have gone quite distracted	2.315362854710811
wickham has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character	1.7702502740840047
darcy seemed much pleased with the attention	1.7775452997991648
smiles decked the face of mrs	1.0583647824115614
bingleys being imposed on than that mr	1.9760955265843547
darcy you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner you cannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before you and taking her hand he would have given it to mr	2.080008444793266
in her own past behaviour there was a constant source of vexation and regret and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin	2.138941291326924
colonel forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body	2.589519133946819
i shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on	1.7812339420322336
he saw wickham and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia	1.4182113897126425

jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from caroline	2.201389754868739
they battled it together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved	1.7197487018561566
with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr	1.8023117685141137
my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room	3.0533153749350563
miss darcys praise occupied the chief of it	2.2550335363752336
accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me	1.203435540801541
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations	2.2980034565676157
what an excellent father you have girls said she when the door was shut	3.1992767189396063
gardiner had seen pemberley and known the late mr	1.83249010790945
let me never see either one or the other again yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former lover	1.6289223999333007
elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingleys regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it	1.757885423385983
there is nothing else to be done	4.386408995290576
darcy speaking to her ayebecause she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he could not help answering herbut she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to miss bingley told me said jane that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance	1.573575958332227
it is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country	2.910150639846413
elizabeth though she did not credit above half of what was said believed enough to make her former assurance of her sisters ruin still more certain and even jane who believed still less of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now come when if they had gone to scotland which she had never before entirely despaired of they must in all probability have gained some news of them	1.6787875174660218
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching and a fortnight only was wanting of it when a letter arrived from mrs	1.204689707135128
but lizzy you have been very sly very reserved with me	2.64282534439289
my visit was not long as caroline and mrs	2.0521333646523376
it is such a spur to ones genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind	1.608317524675055
it is just as he chooses	2.6026182635040938
you are so strange	4.601755760009171
they were not the only objects of mr	2.1037178717297396
there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself	2.1522055981534765
they soon outstripped the others and when they had reached the carriage mr	1.840618856571444
it must be his own doing he is his own master	1.7788332385762295
darcy than they had before any idea of it was evident that he was very much in love with her	3.5665936356624486
presuming however that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of society a perfect willingness to accept it she ventured to engage for her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on	1.5579441024249767
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton a most convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliners shop just over the way	1.4785207161283345
the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himselffrom whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousins affairs and whose character she had no reason to question	1.7804095600928251
from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them	1.8071800907594004
an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched and already had mrs	1.8493146277221346
her mothers ungraciousness made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeths mind and she would at times have given any thing to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family	2.3451916492200087
see paragraph NUM c below	3.8371748200999454
her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressingroom to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself	2.04982081605818
i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object	3.773285185919516
we will go round the park every day	4.540638171116071
i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it	1.9376352948528062
it was an evening of no common delight to them all the satisfaction of miss bennets mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face as made her look handsomer than ever	1.8292194282245944
in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls without any selfreproach	1.55978669323266
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs	2.5956858500775124
our importance our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydias character	1.600610740385353
in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be observed in them for ever yes indeed cried mrs	1.7386960960019215
four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunts arrival	1.948545364978818
after lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation of thinking that mr	1.6760599444324393
this is an evening of wonders indeed	1.8454309655376815
darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friends inclination or why upon his own judgment alone he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy but she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him	2.090358291205479
they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others for who as lady catherine herself condescendingly says will connect themselves with such a family	1.5808611367146024
but it is of small importance i might as well enquire replied she why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character	1.7311774876746002
as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner	2.5354017699200746
does he know his real character i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did	2.357829998740687
it was the last of the regiments stay in meryton and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace	4.760683426872315
bingley of course returned with him to dinner and in the evening mrs	3.2887651165278906
i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not mrs	2.0707996374484483
darcy she left elizabeth to walk by herself	1.8408513831689315
they were ignorant idle and vain	1.7601671968555195
but that gentleman looking at darcy seemed to think the country was nothing at all indeed mama you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for her mother	1.9706618316593159
by the author of sense and sensibility vol	2.941621145665181
you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have tortured methough it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression	1.822516271401699
bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future	2.219316107753396
darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the doorbell and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room	1.7136397974740945
there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings she was a little revived however by his bringing back his coffee cup himself and she seized the opportunity of saying is your sister at pemberley still yes she will remain there till christmas and quite alone	1.8027562465552807
you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general	3.3784091172078536
will you do me the honour of reading that letter and then with a slight bow turned again into the plantation and was soon out of sight	1.769221337167514
into one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance	1.4687299473050277
when is your turn to come	6.041778807839775
as for wickham and lydia their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters	2.194142717213718
there is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping i dare say no nothing at all a great deal of good management depend upon it	1.475282476635211
they had frequently been staying with her in town	2.723449566242325
he sat down for a few moments and then getting up walked about the room	1.5309620161609685
in short i will do my best perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often	2.4377384933518176
and it is such a good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now now kitty you may cough as much as you chuse said mr	2.128624876140104
my dear madam he replied this invitation is particularly gratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible they were all astonished and mr	2.7304325938304883
jane i take your place now and you must go lower because i am a married woman it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first	2.144431369047077
gardiner the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share	1.7270112433426386
lizzy said he what are you doing	3.106548451698496
his behaviour to myself has been scandalous but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened with all her heart but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry	1.673871610887825
my dear lydia she cried when shall we meet again oh lord	2.0923674973510966
our plain manner of living our small rooms and few domestics and the little we see of the world must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness	1.783514907158216
wickham were returned and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball	1.9447723290308248
he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs	2.411262701428258
every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months but he never distinguished her by any particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during the whole of the journey	1.499377265622009
hurst had a house	3.795389567607232
that is the place to get husbands	3.769178991322972
i have been a disappointed man and my spirits will not bear solitude	1.72652874996825
he has heartily forgiven me now elizabeth longed to observe that mr	1.7524115653323282
this preservative she had now obtained and at the age of twentyseven without having ever been handsome she felt all the good luck of it	1.7429736454572407
she was overpowered by shame and vexation	1.7506604744271135
darcys having both spent three weeks at rosings and asked him if he were acquainted with the former	2.807287220285402
bennet you are wanted immediately we are all in an uproar	2.5869519467999518
the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane and in short as the time drew near she would have been very sorry for any delay	1.4045563570703676
are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do oh yes	2.9462092965414866
from their infancy they have been intended for each other	1.7672788414076936
there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed i am very sensible madam of the hardship to my fair cousins and could say much on the subject but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate	1.5345100278251382
they entered it in one of its lowest points and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent	1.8985001310030287
he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter of which it seems he has been told by some of the goodnatured gossiping lucases	1.3189521820881076
wickhams charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could bring no proof of its injustice	1.6391846249730553
i know you will contrive it all but mr	3.2616331571055435
my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them	2.985381532180344
elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked towards his friend	1.5775792045029098
when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen they returned down stairs and taking leave of the housekeeper were consigned over to the gardener who met them at the hall door	2.338438766151484
but the case is this	2.223018374826083
yours c as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind	1.9623195083792662
it was moreover such a promising thing for her younger daughters as janes marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked	1.9222726919723006
pray do not talk of that odious man	2.669902725268436
bennet treated the matter differently	1.5928942949029354
i quite detest the man chapter iv	2.961169688417658
and one of my own daughters	3.534344304523924
bennet with more perseverance than politeness protested he must be entirely mistaken and lydia always unguarded and often uncivil boisterously exclaimed good lord	1.4631315305558428
elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister for while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on any one else but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur	2.049689835604203
bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he could to the great consolation of his sister who considered it as the only security for her husbands not being killed in a duel	2.1497359920297954
his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it	2.255787829192017
i am going to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows you are a very strange creature by way of a friend always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body if my vanity had taken a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers on miss lucass persevering however she added very well if it must be so it must and gravely glancing at mr	1.8042547731905314
the little gardiners attracted by the sight of a chaise were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock and when the carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety of capers and frisks was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome	1.892570447119887
darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning	1.7490551729536272
jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs	1.8339177195575567
it cannot be concealed from any one	3.379230123018533
bingleys being there and as to the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his	2.0656395674866164
the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every mornings impatience	1.3118826121351996
but i have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr	1.8316421304665618
reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his fathers life time	3.543849182428601
she had only to say in reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge	3.4489108628595164
generous good man i am afraid he has distressed himself	1.5335986421247385
lydiathe humiliation the misery she was bringing on them all soon swallowed up every private care and covering her face with her handkerchief elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else and after a pause of several minutes was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion who in a manner which though it spoke compassion spoke likewise restraint said i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay but real though unavailing concern	1.5864650501511797
collins she added that lizzy shall be brought to reason	2.2772232599499556
her figure was elegant and she walked wellbut darcy at whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious	1.6646690385175638
why does she not come in oh	1.8831900188339075
her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved	1.709701541250457
limited right of replacement or refund if you discover a defect in this electronic work within NUM days of receiving it you can receive a refund of the money if any you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from	1.3324587471280096
but now it was all too natural	3.151771461379514
stupid men are the only ones worth knowing after all take care lizzy that speech savours strongly of disappointment before they were separated by the conclusion of the play she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer	1.3252470009545005
bennet arrived he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure	2.420083925274717
she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger and wondered it had escaped her before	2.050391347633245
her mind was less difficult to develope	3.1630614895337597
my dear mr	3.302139563751554
this was his plan of amendsof atonementfor inheriting their fathers estate and he thought it an excellent one full of eligibility and suitableness and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part	1.5118385159836913
however i did not hear above one word in ten for i was thinking you may suppose of my dear wickham	2.4424295788318604
but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i could would mr	1.9191840700892906
but who was your mother	4.812251479806779
she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend	1.9603020980389085
she wrote also with great pleasure of her brothers being an inmate of mr	1.872990737163879
it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give but they were now necessary and she assured him with some confusion of her attachment to mr	2.235174536040281
tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet with great pleasure	3.0185946658632137
but papa is so disagreeable a little seabathing would set me up for ever and my aunt philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good added kitty	1.4783001848641926
no principle of either would be violated by my marriage with mr	1.493691481077288
to the rest of the family they paid little attention avoiding mrs	3.7552369755521
well much good may it do them	1.7656005776547496
darcy with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her	1.6887137334351778
charlottes first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home how she would like lady catherine and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be though when the letters were read elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen	1.5519337822273038
lady catherine said she you have given me a treasure are any of your younger sisters out miss bennet yes maam all all what all five out at once	1.552267712788113
there was also a postscript to this effect	3.7659426100963302
not handsome enough to dance with	2.39658058176955
lydias voice was heard in the vestibule the door was thrown open and she ran into the room	2.540958836201454
her astonishment at his comingat his coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire	1.8003468941360707
she saw with the creative eye of fancy the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers	1.5112903013830714
your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not goand at another word might stay a month you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that mr	1.3887275092352922
he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming said her uncle	3.7091998291106787
she listened most attentively to all that passed between them and gloried in every expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence his taste or his good manners	1.4490013841141394
unless a copyright notice is included	3.4190278449281
if he had another motive i am sure it would never disgrace him	3.680638227973243
there can be no love in all this	3.773372587754088
it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her	2.4084818339232057
the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of ranksuch affability and condescension as he had himself experienced from lady catherine	2.435944823876806
clements because wickhams lodgings were in that parish	1.087129288021451
they are going to be encamped near brighton and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer	2.5489351235392284
what will be his surprise thought she when he knows who they are	2.185036011123707
teazing teazing man	1.0704403123309147
bingleys will always be welcome here to be sure but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern	1.833969883611487
all field sports were over	2.220495419790942
for my own part she rejoined i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her	4.238415043948861
jane was so admired nothing could be like it	1.8102930919976683
you refuse then to oblige me	3.1958404281524846
when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas and was in conversation with her when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr	1.9610035559359944
once or twice she could discern a faint blush but in general charlotte wisely did not hear	1.4538465001833807
i have by no means done	1.7207480903839072
they were therefore to go elizabeth was pleased though when she asked herself the reason she had very little to say in reply	1.8746276467644964
i am truly glad dearest lizzy that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes but now as the first shock is over shall i own that i long for your return	2.554853510996931
the officers will find women better worth their notice	1.9603273564652415
not one party or scheme or any thing	2.6064848768225506
for my part mr	4.997079439218333
when the teathings were removed and the card tables placed the ladies all rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mothers rapacity for whist players and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party	1.7532430481777002
reynoldss respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master	1.088812429805377
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command	2.4855340855040335
and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater beauty	2.3142583740658527
it is a great comfort to have you so rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will think of us	3.7993052693738165
and if i am that choice why may not i accept him because honour decorum prudence nay interest forbid it	2.1599886722029322
that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance oh	2.2898993460068757
her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies	1.8479631547253033
it would have been strange if they had	3.854120001970426
he immediately offered to fetch her others all that his library afforded	1.4040220639459489
end of the second volume	3.9191922760279723
my father and mother believe the worst but i cannot think so ill of him	3.5838413158118856
if they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us if he were so they could not succeed	2.576646596664061
she was very wrong in singling me out as she did i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side	1.9147523592822961
of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity	2.415677552319555
it appeared to her merely the suggestion of carolines interested wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes however openly or artfully spoken could influence a young man so totally independent of every one	1.3418116367146788
bingley if she could	18.349654306506125
you shall not defend her though it is charlotte lucas	2.3561610136162
the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow	2.2232659991446457
all were struck with the strangers air all wondered who he could be and kitty and lydia determined if possible to find out led the way across the street under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot	1.6479278859230935
whats his name	1.0704403123309147
wickham who had returned with him the day before from town and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps	1.3908415308477666
human nature is so prone to fall into it	1.1728895388249863
on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now	1.7511981617165577
it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday senight elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him that mr	2.8363367735282274
on reaching the house they were shewn through the hall into the saloon whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer	1.9871619830511726
it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure	1.7850304537298294
but perhaps his sister does as well for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he likes with her no said colonel fitzwilliam that is an advantage which he must divide with me	2.443203520182787
i can recal nothing worse	2.6461596056443812
c and if she would give him leave would take an early opportunity of waiting on them	2.825620312743947
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece and the kind of halfexpectation which mrs	2.309081399250435
at length there was nothing more to be said the ladies drove on and the others returned into the house	2.9514697871155247
wickham and give him an invitation also if the family from longbourn would come in the evening	1.7697120093487884
it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before but that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed so doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea	1.6775789291645697
this information however startled mrs	1.9096758186652454
is her husband is the son of his late fathers steward to be his brother	2.0559615367378403
elizabeth was disgusted and even miss bennet was shocked	1.8218070070044017
my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday after my father went away and was so good as to stay till thursday with me	2.367100758767195
at length in a voice of forced calmness he said and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting	2.4155156032161624
my mind was more agreeably engaged	1.669061121664484
but it is returned she for mrs	2.182478074871323
bingleys she could not make a very favourable answer	4.725344958828791
she had very little notice from any but him	1.5499679333718628
the rest of the evening passed with the appearance on his side of usual cheerfulness but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth and they parted at last with mutual civility and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again	1.5902426537095418
lady catherine listened to half a song and then talked as before to her other nephew till the latter walked away from her and moving with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performers countenance	1.3191981786043712
egerton military library whitehall	3.442989613031403
but with me it is not so	7.96362836761035
bingley when questioned by jane had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair that proud and repulsive as were his manners she had never in the whole course of their acquaintance an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjustany thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits	1.7193019623516528
ring the bell kitty for hill	1.0704403123309147
at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity	2.1723897501509675
but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs	2.746976290885692
my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how imprudent a match it must be	2.523571485054689
he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former	1.9863747253838273
did you see it bingley replied that he did and made his congratulations	2.5532081912440816
their lodgings were not long a secret and at length they began to know the officers themselves	1.835864694750287
she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct	1.3465792770416467
it cannot be for me it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened	2.0716461774508663
a gamester she cried	2.2905523421966123
excuse my interference it was kindly meant insolent girl said elizabeth to herself you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this	1.514642441001605

we passed each other several times	1.7772479536598151
how could you begin said she	3.5660254088830277
but however that shant prevent my asking him to dine here i am determined	3.236370161706343
bennet i am quite delighted with him	6.669968982368716
he had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it	2.057258214483905
it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us	1.6192892451337257
jane was not deceived but she was affected and though feeling no reliance on her could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved	1.5189302324579093
at our time of life it is not so pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintance every day but for your sakes we would do any thing	1.764232216640365
there is no danger of wickhams marrying mary king	1.8914405312342335
their father then went to the library to write and the girls walked into the breakfastroom	2.7169032194547547
yes said elizabeth drily mr	2.489757511539813
my father was not only fond of this young mans society whose manners were always engaging he had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be his profession intended to provide for him in it	1.5920082983547714
i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time	1.9167109831947737
she put down the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartialitydeliberated on the probability of each statementbut with little success	1.5547860857673026
bennet was quite disconcerted	3.3527059070769925
in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage	2.959833789748395
i will read you the passage which particularly hurts me	2.4359646165184783
bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydias interruption and promised that it should not occur again if he would resume his book but mr	2.2175205342134983
bingley urged mr	2.00869497659548
collins for having spoken so sensibly and observed in a halfwhisper to lady lucas that he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man	2.3561945742884904
amongst the most violent against him was mrs	1.0770849363754273
no i am sure we never read the same or not with the same feelings i am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be no want of subject we may compare our different opinions noi cannot talk of books in a ballroom my head is always full of something else the present always occupies you in such scenesdoes it said he with a look of doubt	1.862262197950481
gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction	1.634751015718548
joness being sent for immediately while his sisters convinced that no country advice could be of any service recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians	1.953277163684865
collins joining in observed yes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church and i need not say you will be delighted with her	1.7183865544605887
gardiner who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible	2.6325004975788007
and then you know when once they get together there is no end of it	2.513939324490124
it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that his affection might be reanimated and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of janes attractions	1.9663148999063982
pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel fitzwilliam	2.9635588576014724
it is too long ago	1.897596849278528
darcy who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish and who probably never looked at you in his life	2.1505497475976214
she was disappointed and angry with herself for being so	1.8689993837353278
could he or the lucases have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related	1.6748521835303134
they shook hands with great cordiality and then till her sister came down she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness and of janes perfections and in spite of his being a lover elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded because they had for basis the excellent understanding and superexcellent disposition of jane and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself	1.4728680757224575
collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs	1.4078517269860582
there is a lady it seems a mrs	1.9543463427684138
collins was punctual to his time and was received with great politeness by the whole family	2.0334119867494818
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth and elizabeth agitated and confused rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so for besides the immediate embarrassment there were other evils before her	2.5062321773177056
all that is required of you is to assure to your daughter by settlement her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister and moreover to enter into an engagement of allowing her during your life one hundred pounds per annum	1.7525018971198665
the good news quickly spread through the house and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood	1.620488775586855
that she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head	2.4835429567197163
the favour of your company has been much felt i assure you	1.9136656663623852
the conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable but since then we have both i hope improved in civility i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself	1.7532304901962366
and as i come back i can call on lady lucas and mrs	2.098523103541103
they attacked him in various ways with barefaced questions ingenious suppositions and distant surmises but he eluded the skill of them all and they were at last obliged to accept the secondhand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas	1.4771647708471942
kitty was the only one who shed tears but she did weep from vexation and envy	1.9023551779647785
i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part except the shops and public places	1.9094594797763476
collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be imaginary	2.3139303481853752
how strange this is	3.8782588884267617
miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth	1.7866447958575453
i know my dear uncle and aunt so well that i am not afraid of requesting it though i have still something more to ask of the former	3.0775899947313308
miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility mr	1.5382138683673046
he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stoodthe sort of preference which was often given me i had not thought mr	2.0573452112238937
never since reading janes second letter had she entertained a hope of wickhams meaning to marry her	1.7418741658167587
he observed to her at a moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had something of real regret that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her and before she could reply he added it is above eight months	2.3128737231603833
i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one but i always speak what i think i know you do and it is that which makes the wonder	2.088780804010462
darcy walked off and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him	1.349123722149211
not these two or three years perhaps write to me very often my dear as often as i can	1.9051809241103705
wickham immediately to elizabeths mind and from the observation of the day altogether she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented	1.8419229869416451
bingley did not do justice to his own disposition	2.3940978794205057
darcy he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam	2.857667982025871
i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that dining out said mrs	1.8319385485105795
to the little town of lambton the scene of mrs	2.4950852971587767
accordingly when she retired at night she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place what was the name of its proprietor and with no little alarm whether the family were down for the summer	1.6004753297950864
but the fact is that we are very different sort of men and that he hates me this is quite shocking he deserves to be publicly disgraced some time or other he will bebut it shall not be by me	1.7356460599286039
the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of	1.8436426505794947
i do not trust my own partiality	1.725487032630136
bennet and the children	3.027624735139029
i cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns as i often see done my fingers said elizabeth do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many womens do	1.2729667966718272
can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand oh yes that that is the worst of all	2.7912443753393066
as soon as they entered the copse lady catherine began in the following manner you can be at no loss miss bennet to understand the reason of my journey hither	2.763642155745785
bennetshe would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not to believe it and could not help saying so	2.1272513460564197
has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves	2.2183619720413543
tell him what a dreadful state i am in that i am frightened out of my wits and have such tremblings such flutterings all over me such spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day	1.7934698847468609
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world though only a few weeks before when lydia had first run away they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune	1.8329309788496755
oh lord	3.625735738006499
it would vex me indeed to see you again the dupe of miss bingleys pretended regard would you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last november he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again he made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of his modesty this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence and the little value he put on his own good qualities	2.1288260072876817
there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer and i have enquired of every body too who is likely to know i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more oh well	2.368271210938528
her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas forbore to invite him to sit by herself	1.8053400705901077
she was roused from her seat and her reflections by some ones approach and before she could strike into another path she was overtaken by wickham	1.6026080960084697
jane was distressed	2.4639613724123626
having been frequently in company with him since her return agitation was pretty well over the agitations of former partiality entirely so	1.4752541230344558
i could hardly keep my countenance	6.096196258568397
the foundations ein or federal tax identification number is NUMNUM	2.1542306231875847
additional terms will be linked to the project gutenbergtm license for all works posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work	2.3704558896628014
they were off saturday night about twelve as is conjectured but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight	1.3386189343847352
bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield which was fixed for the following tuesday	1.641680237675111
you and the girls may go or you may send them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are as handsome as any of them mr	1.907656225646732
with them he is remarkably agreeable i do not believe a word of it my dear	2.450291257703035
in as short a time as mr	1.6093574625449254
the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion	2.8750610652562725
i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family	1.9390764434121681
without a governess you must have been neglected compared with some families i believe we were but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means	1.9955343090373083
what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosings park when he put his letter into her hand	1.5638736166374108
i could not bear to have her ten miles from me and as for purvis lodge the attics are dreadful her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained	1.8371419067053074
gardiner with occasional help from elizabeth the conversation was carried on	2.069232128503458
but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and i dare say very agreeable	3.542899854557615
and then we were so merry all the way home	3.166670699260502
of this she was perfectly unawareto her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with	2.1709183169768442
london printed for t	3.442989613031403
my feelings in every respect forbid it	3.0074963132070884
of a fine stout healthy love it may	2.0772988115574407
however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters	1.7743385887271133
i had not an idea of it mr	3.744116444437904
you have delighted us long enough	2.9587106959814324
as no objection was made to the young peoples engagement with their aunt and all mr	1.666060261489122
but she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so illjudged a direction of talents talents which rightly used might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife	1.8669971494246942
wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her with the promise of balls and young men her father would never consent to her going	1.6609401360431686
his former acquaintance had been numerous but since he had been in the militia it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them	2.6056479304454676
they have a sharp shrewish look which i do not like at all and in her air altogether there is a selfsufficiency without fashion which is intolerable persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth this was not the best method of recommending herself but angry people are not always wise and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled she had all the success she expected	2.1693501802272888
she looked at jane to see how she bore it but jane was very composedly talking to bingley	2.3231481612673504
yours very sincerely m	3.0873239241749797
i am astonished said miss bingley that my father should have left so small a collection of books what a delightful library you have at pemberley mr	1.7673101880912263
