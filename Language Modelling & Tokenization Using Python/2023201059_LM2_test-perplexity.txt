Average Perplexity: 127.93983394745626
this has been my motive my fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem	148.88707212331195
it was at sir william lucass where a large party were assembled	47.263837195483575
bennet and kitty walked off and as soon as they were gone mr	41.66146001617914
elizabeth after slightly surveying it went to a window to enjoy its prospect	342.4154245625266
not to appear to disgrace his family to degenerate from the popular qualities or lose the influence of the pemberley house is a powerful motive	230.804816884946
gardiners caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone after honestly telling her what she thought she thus went on you are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because you are warned against it and therefore i am not afraid of speaking openly	313.84564260145976
she is well and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother yours c	136.28211301924773
darcy with an expression of halflaughing alarm	25.760263369067275
his marriage was now fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an illnatured tone that she wished they might be happy thursday was to be the wedding day and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit and when she rose to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her mothers ungracious and reluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied her out of the room	400.12536979560565
bingley returned mr	46.22203459261605
collinss letter and after laughing at her some time allowed her at last to gosaying as she quitted the room if any young men come for mary or kitty send them in for i am quite at leisure elizabeths mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight and after half an hours quiet reflection in her own room she was able to join the others with tolerable composure	310.1519645392416
they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects	187.66615428166867
no no you shall not deceive me	64.97306160139527
philips a very attentive listener whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could	278.8692581470218
elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from pemberley	323.32014052432083
hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves	156.17444576276503
at length however the question was asked by her uncle and she turned away with alarm while mrs	80.29538897085293
i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to mr	47.14850681814889
you will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one i cannot pretend to be sorry said wickham after a short interruption that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts but with him i believe it does not often happen	164.15532750987268
i roused and interested you because i was so unlike them	404.5360998504862
she could not determine how her mother would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man	260.40897186592406
much as i abominate writing i would not give up mr	67.24218958809703
bennet give up the point	34.20318314525386
happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance	326.58281888800786
there was no help for it however	35.77625988418073
and then when you go away you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over i thank you for my share of the favour said elizabeth but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them	197.27228046903429
you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night	108.02405886206226
i hope added mrs	40.717911255973135
gardiner i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body as he has done by poor wickham	120.22083469395439
her mother stepped forwards embraced her and welcomed her with rapture gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham who followed his lady and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness	360.4984876194389
but when she read and reread with the closest attention the particulars immediately following of wickhams resigning all pretensions to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate	419.38505620168263
it is unaccountable	15.6860103581952
bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproof nothing is more deceitful said darcy than the appearance of humility	322.5834427092266
you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper	229.97976276186498
sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine what think you of books said he smiling	268.22724957867615
lydias going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husbands never intending to go there himself	188.15705080498702
darcy to be treating his fathers favourite in such a manner one whom his father had promised to provide for it is impossible	83.29324230163371
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as elizabeth half expected mr	325.3763462680074
long said miss lucas but i wish he had danced with eliza another time lizzy said her mother i would not dance with him if i were you i believe maam i may safely promise you never to dance with him his pride said miss lucas does not offend me so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for it	193.13463353789555
darcy and herself	6.692105319999651
if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand it does not advance their felicity in the least	243.15370015162065
darcys pleasure in the bingleys invitation to the officers and though this was not exactly the case the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr	115.15480446699999
no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrasseda resolution the more necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room	216.56864615109535
you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him	51.58541926216621
the carriage was sent to meet them at and they were to return in it by dinnertime	77.18898486867951
it was really a very handsome thought	27.93972341079234
what a meeting for her when she first sees my aunt we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side said jane i hope and trust they will yet be happy	138.34707194846447
darcy will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right	198.6892206046783
any alternate format must include the full project gutenbergtm license as specified in paragraph NUM e NUM	111.03315759399032
gardiners behaviour laid them all under	538.9578474349904
you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the young people	80.99544075801806
it was first broken by mrs	67.42899725003319
when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject	129.93154404062793
her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where mr	181.71417155061087
i found said he as the time drew near that i had better not meet mr	78.2222135400323
well well i only hope it will last	39.05407858867679
elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it	55.07851642265638
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife was exactly what he had wished for and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady catherines condescension as he knew not how to admire enough	220.92697222998115
darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public	194.34840954434495
the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking mr	118.85222315435158
her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious as bingley had now been gone a week and nothing was heard of his return	364.9911018246409
i know not miss elizabeth said he whether mrs	59.81981089329723
when jane and elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautious in her praise of mr	73.62424023867132
i have faults enough but they are not i hope of understanding	70.0730727322794
there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention while she added when i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement but that from knowing him better his disposition was better understood wickhams alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look for a few minutes he was silent till shaking off his embarrassment he turned to her again and said in the gentlest of accents you who so well know my feelings towards mr	330.0340458282711
oh lydia i comfort myself with thinking replied jane that he certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her	161.969975149608
i believe him to be lady catherines nephew	38.797076884096654
till the next morning however she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance	63.65230535481156
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat cake and a variety of all the finest fruits in season but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs	354.12065277555195
i dare say the lace upon mrs	38.206677370727746
and above all things keep mr	72.33596429728449
well if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own so much the better	79.8136661845283
but really and upon my honour i will try to do what i think to be wisest and now i hope you are satisfied her aunt assured her that she was and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints they parted a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented	197.67508358343682
i do not know when i have been more shocked said she	31.45254128702023
will you be very angry with me my dear lizzy if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold enough to say before how much i like him	55.43594894160112
imprudent as a marriage between mr	79.52502043309558
at any rate she cannot grow many degrees worse without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content but her own opinion continued the same and she left him disappointed and sorry	225.39495312003612
bingleys heart were entertained	395.98012074974156
if you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a project gutenbergtm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement you may obtain a refund from the person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph NUM e NUM	56.23677609399178
she attracted him more than he likedand miss bingley was uncivil to her and more teazing than usual to himself	126.15690680280736
i am very glad to hear such a good account of her said lady catherine and pray tell her from me that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practise a great deal i assure you madam he replied that she does not need such advice	81.5927859430012
i should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship ten thousand pounds	23.140674778460443
bingley had danced with her twice and she had been distinguished by his sisters	30.813450827009106
it was the prospect of constant society and good society he added which was my chief inducement to enter the shire	281.0771920628898
what could become of mr	26.05656454189841
she then joined them soon enough to see lydia with anxious parade walk up to her mothers right hand and hear her say to her eldest sister ah	279.5640173931396
a man of honour could not have doubted the intention but mr	106.63482782645207

bennet as she entered the room we have had a most delightful evening a most excellent ball	75.47342332107088
but if we do not venture somebody else will and after all mrs	91.49804333497167
a person may be proud without being vain	146.35818733304853
elizabeth for the sake of saying something that might turn her mothers thoughts now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away	141.8465133324866
darcy so bad as thisthough i have never liked him i had not thought so very ill of himi had supposed him to be despising his fellowcreatures in general but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity as this after a few minutes reflection however she continued i do remember his boasting one day at netherfield of the implacability of his resentments of his having an unforgiving temper	306.0769026335435
but while he was mortal there must be a triumph	86.22700206492695
bennet one communication would therefore do for all	335.96877894278987
from the entrance hall of which mr	73.50389145620643
bennet was not in the habit of walking mary could never spare time but the remaining five set off together	124.29304125809635
bingley her sisters being in town	17.005312785914082
we do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance	317.66974402610373
morris immediately that he is to take possession before michaelmas and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week what is his name bingley is he married or single oh	222.57411449976658
unless the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped	399.81581416944454
reflection must be reserved for solitary hours whenever she was alone she gave way to it as the greatest relief and not a day went by without a solitary walk in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections	465.80034850257863
thoughtlessness want of attention to other peoples feelings and want of resolution will do the business and do you impute it to either of those yes to the last	227.67959994781975
of the ladys sensations they remained a little in doubt but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough	461.72249415259245
darcy took her advice and did finish his letter	57.23410108989894
his character sunk on every review of it and as a punishment for him as well as a possible advantage to jane she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr	223.44583833908862
he owed a good deal in the town but his debts of honour were still more formidable	138.08494380803754
he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity sensible that if such an idea had been suggested his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it	569.4290351464217
you have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew	78.08295486276805
but perhaps he could not in her mothers presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt	52.568470643583794
see URL or URL URL or URL images of the original pages are available through internet archive	622.7695600213734
she was ashamed to think how much	29.56663728518564
if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course	227.35741872280988
darcy was punctual in his return and as lydia informed you attended the wedding	235.79718887087796
his being such a charming young man and so rich and living but three miles from them were the first points of selfgratulation and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do	130.1166542483752
darcy in wretched suspense could only say something indistinctly of his concern and observe her in compassionate silence	360.00613766701395
he arranges the business just as he pleases and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice	118.60450166035437
hurst began again	88.00355912090961
they descended the hill crossed the bridge and drove to the door and while examining the nearer aspect of the house all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned	560.0791250345911
the country is a vast deal pleasanter is not it mr	81.79440350992132
for my part i am inclined to believe it all mr	20.31209211552836
she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia and removed from the influence of lydias example she became by proper attention and management less irritable less ignorant and less insipid	672.789689777093
bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield	78.84402308096683
she was more alive to the disgrace which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughters nuptials than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they took place	303.11034002142463
yesit would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again	163.1493480038428
he sat with them above an hour and was in remarkably good spirits	61.034556443845275
darcy can please where he chuses	171.8095082476669
darcys sister as by wickhams account she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away	370.15415004486346
i am not qualified to form one	64.9465829224395
wickhams intention to go into the regulars and among his former friends there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army	240.17624885642226
bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner and then added may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr	182.20535579073885
an airing would do me a great deal of good i am sure	60.20737366459955
will you come and see me we shall often meet i hope in hertfordshire i am not likely to leave kent for some time	100.29190735478495
she looked at jane and smiled and shook her head by turns	49.72238194786522
one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight	39.64691572913268
please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses	517.8018248348693
colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon	226.1671471259305
charlotte is an excellent manager i dare say	46.09302097135577
darcys next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in gracechurchstreet the evening before i came home	208.2791874023793
but i can assure you she added that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not at all worth pleasing	167.33467036061418
the officer was the very mr	84.44687084863439
after sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view mr	55.482626640412406
i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner	32.696669578150086
he could number the fields in every direction and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump	399.43522045574
with no greater events than these in the longbourn family and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton sometimes dirty and sometimes cold did january and february pass away	1071.9231253748928
he added that mr	13.56464932862362
lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephews letter that charlotte really rejoicing in the match was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over	321.0139201438861
under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief	205.66634450038774
bennet as soon as they were out of the house as ever i saw	15.41439640961389
are you going much farther no i should have turned in a moment and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonage together	235.60973030111722
darcy as much as i ever wish to be cried elizabeth warmly i have spent four days in the same house with him and i think him very disagreeable i have no right to give my opinion said wickham as to his being agreeable or otherwise	139.5431424880478
and this said she is the end of all his friends anxious circumspection	56.69964899028506
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forsters	218.21148894539377
but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant	79.00176071507978
though her manner varied however her determination never did	710.0023369803209
their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party i assure you i feel it exceedingly said lady catherine i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do	93.78060084918665
wickham and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr	28.99116369343989
darcy and you yourself when last at longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him	139.36961552041555
before any answer could arrive from mr	216.2951303207062
bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him myself how can you be so teazing i honour your circumspection	159.82905048296033
but are you pleased jane	46.59745842656115
i must find mr	21.18381596365882
she wrote cheerfully seemed surrounded with comforts and mentioned nothing which she could not praise	395.7542553371227
bennet replied his wife how can you be so tiresome	50.27238333819634
good gracious cried mrs	25.618103005056202
we now come to the point	58.323299643250984
we dine at rosings twice every week and are never allowed to walk home	229.55353948830444
bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle i should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers elizabeth made no answer	127.08571309695664
her many attractions were again dwelt on and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter	413.8417237760952
collins for she vows she will not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her mr	67.87401857598356
but no letter appeared and she was completely puzzled	141.41202780672648
at length the parsonage was discernible	44.55142839929516
to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town or as the happiest alternative been secluded from the world in some distant farm house	216.46917134951778
lizzy my dear run down to your father and ask him how much he will give her	74.75475455309665
it was in the times and the courier i know though it was not put in as it ought to be	68.02680089241976
how wonderfully these sort of things occur	841.3181524635768
i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit	233.35104129168315
bingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at longbourn coming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till after supper unless when some barbarous neighbour who could not be enough detested had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept	366.1937020087257
i think she will be pleased with the hermitage elizabeth obeyed and running into her own room for her parasol attended her noble guest down stairs	147.95706926626107
if she does not object to it why should we her not objecting does not justify him	137.44965828869536
i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier	214.86725567941332
give me farther particulars	36.82687917398513
you mentioned two instances	142.5013786551895
and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs	25.928290443787894
lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed	155.16873926045304
i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned mr	198.91028278197604
as they walked across the lawn towards the river elizabeth turned back to look again her uncle and aunt stopped also and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables	343.84638607060583
but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr	224.42513828876696
my dear dear jane i am so happy	10.621869822717949
bingley himself elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied before mr	239.2984808203268
collins seemed neither in need of encouragement nor inclined to be silent himself	401.388350311024
i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you it is evident by this added jane that he comes back no more this winter it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should why will you think so	302.6437177704006
from something that he told me in our journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him	188.73997525900498
collins in describing the civility of mr	29.94853464754551
is there nothing you could take to give you present relief a glass of wineshall i get you one you are very ill no i thank you she replied endeavouring to recover herself	359.3111841588587
this invaluable friend was a very young woman and very lately married	108.89377393634436
but before she had been three minutes in her own room her mother followed her	80.3894609752481
her aunt asked her smilingly how she liked it	248.13643040925626
he does not want abilities	55.23627934108275
gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power elizabeth though expecting no less thanked him with tears of gratitude and all three being actuated by one spirit every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled	666.8987502549533
you may convert to and distribute this work in any binary compressed marked up nonproprietary or proprietary form including any word processing or hypertext form	627.1802744978154
can i speak plainer	55.66605031267678
elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could	45.759931811360524
i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony	43.890644168596346
every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane	43.34003056355553
but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render mr	387.14717818984275
wickham who left the place immediately and mrs	73.89807937314683
very well that reply will do for the present perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones but now we may be silent do you talk by rule then while you are dancing sometimes	848.3300937151105
he did trace them easily to clapham but no farther for on entering that place they removed into a hackneycoach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom	1038.8899385849534
she had never heard of his having had any relations except a father and mother both of whom had been dead many years	107.70230689499738
bingley comes my dear said mrs	31.869263209475207
their other aunt also visited them frequently and always as she said with the design of cheering and heartening them up though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickhams extravagance or irregularity she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them	506.0500159676653
till i was in kent and saw so much both of mr	51.655796406330126
she was wild to be at hometo hear to see to be upon the spot to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her in a family so deranged a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and requiring constant attendance and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia her uncles interference seemed of the utmost importance and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience was severe	477.3006563036732
a ladys imagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to love from love to matrimony in a moment	506.61710200682427
its windows opening to the ground admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn	601.4230126236685
she was a woman of mean understanding little information and uncertain temper	215.73108607176295
by elizabeths instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself	223.74604813886114
what is the matter cried he with more feeling than politeness then recollecting himself i will not detain you a minute but let me or let the servant go after mr	286.1575775168131
the latter was thinking only of his breakfast	97.09224937638047
so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper or her affectionate heart	222.667206852662
but it is fortunate thought she that i have something to wish for	37.570517918231225
yesif darcy does not put it off again	67.28286185112981
since her being at lambton she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy	79.61125930369981
he was always to have gone on saturday and to saturday he still meant to stay	102.32886568472273
where does discretion end and avarice begin	554.1266089512103
a military life is not what i was intended for but circumstances have now made it eligible	433.8558668020855
i hope he will overlook it	79.37410804809817
you must write again very soon and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last	56.12051062424526
theres for you	22.779210386948687
but it is so strange yesthat is what makes it amusing	251.62333181209803
the dinner was exceedingly handsome and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which mr	102.9635520448475
the other is miss de bourgh	15.263461252831794
had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his affection every moment more valuable	202.1897699924376
nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the united states	72.81765114720051
bennet and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman	21.934383564802932
as soon as they had driven from the door elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings which for charlottes sake she made more favourable than it really was	109.88805288708392
bingley not at all he is a sweet tempered amiable charming man	78.12791668333462
gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces	165.6261449849653
gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found elizabeths arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred her husbands	408.3065965363832
you dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse	406.16701866295347
i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield	37.61279107719856
the possibility of meeting mr	24.853906245733807
one days delay she observed would be of small importance and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual	276.7776391184239
i now give it to you if you are resolved on having him	72.63144163496833
collins my dear madam replied he let us be for ever silent on this point	99.12396983850442
gardiner mr	13.537864280720763
you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite	246.88818386019022
the evening passed quietly unmarked by any thing extraordinary	76.93982048240888
if i had ever learnt i should have been a great proficient	45.857214644161566
there is not a bit of fish to be got today	98.24557089491644
this was agreed to and mrs	25.300394484425613
i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had yes he introduced us to his sister and do you like her very much i have heard indeed that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two	171.89787244371516
as they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different positions but from every window there were beauties to be seen	918.573468915213
you write uncommonly fast you are mistaken	176.42667562149293
darcy a most intimate confidential friend	55.269975823080536
bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible advice which there was every reason to believe would be attended to and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard	175.1351951187789
but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was	103.87205507936
my father bears it better	118.94355379488059
you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope though you have but a short lease whatever i do is done in a hurry replied he and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five minutes	215.36780082781448
you know i always speak my mind and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves	148.83726066032196
every thing was too recent for gaiety but the evening passed tranquilly away there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time	310.8143705495968
tis an etiquette i despise said he	652.3263881806073
her father contented with laughing at them would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters and her mother with manners so far from right herself was entirely insensible of the evil	539.8179112872386
you may imagine what i felt and how i acted	78.11715628038452
she could think only of her letter	16.901428224769788
we have reason to imagine that his aunt lady catherine de bourgh does not look on the match with a friendly eye mr	73.51300667751073
could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster	124.7284281208331
be assured my dear sir that mrs	48.333522918763634
i have no such injuries to resent	44.53652235905149
it only shews her being deficient in something herselfsense or feeling well cried elizabeth have it as you choose	468.03637183053604
what could be more natural than his asking you again	40.9934184146154
the express was sent off directly	23.740722726928507
bennet himself while his wife seriously commended mr	209.56717591339188
you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling i am sure you did	134.3412500928779
donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks online payments and credit card donations	1969.6101969084418
they then sat down and when her enquiries after rosings were made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence	413.9818747339133
darcy had considerable patronage in the church and his cousin could have none at all	76.86326692690062
she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country	40.799450995972535
it was very little less	29.635709490225377
there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs	43.515145674962575
if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection elizabeths change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty	1051.1869336341301
as for your elizabeths picture you must not attempt to have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their colour and shape and the eyelashes so remarkably fine might be copied at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs	479.0423884599268
wickham himself no he never saw him till the other morning at meryton this account then is what he has received from mr	145.3723127885243
we shall be at newcastle all the winter and i dare say there will be some balls and i will take care to get good partners for them all i should like it beyond any thing said her mother	98.96455925252623
any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she understood he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield and she blushed as she answered i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family	215.58962882418047
is not general incivility the very essence of love oh yes of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt	160.78672109464847
as yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness	168.1823510682106
it amazes me i confessfor certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction	268.75729795350816
if he wishes to avoid seeing me he must go	113.80171529276224
why any fear of detection	160.24274765902715
vain ignorant idle and absolutely uncontrouled	480.6009830143467
her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable and could she have included jane in the scheme every part of it would have been perfect	300.6104986844992
when dinner was over she returned directly to jane and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room	97.58433376336647
she wrote even to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her former professions of regard	142.43459999230467
and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother said mr	30.32688843541746
he heard her with astonishment	13.597647538560507
bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do	104.79056648356053
between the two eldest and herself especially there subsisted a very particular regard	210.03768049547168
bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity	242.24776945651186
he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce	325.82414518555805
information about donations to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation project gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment	614.4006396391196
you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert	259.0597589754351
i rather expected from my knowledge of her affability that it would happen	133.3190129424818
she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened it was impossible to think of any thing else and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise	206.5985581868744
i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance	126.00371103721406
she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it but she could no longer be blind to miss bingleys inattention	113.57335400993067
i will only add god bless you	494.79262561462303
i should say one of her ladyships carriages for she has several lady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed added charlotte and a most attentive neighbour very true my dear that is exactly what i say	186.86412389182541
and pray what sort of guardians do you make	41.41494895839482
he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them but he had something to direct his search which was more than we had and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us	158.64953444046523
i rather wonder now at your knowing any are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this i never saw such a woman	94.53242182025846
till this moment i never knew myself from herself to janefrom jane to bingley her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr	252.2929169898001
mary was the only daughter who remained at home and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs	154.05991655341327
it was agreed to	13.22699726484304
he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to any one else	45.20372706696453
the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a skreen	243.3399042488139
we dressed up chamberlayne in womans clothes on purpose to pass for a lady only think what fun	486.3395439082977
gardiner and miss bennet to dinner at pemberley before they left the country	45.65864920870105
he addressed himself directly to miss bennet with a polite congratulation mr	57.40063528001324
she was no sooner in possession of it than hurrying into the little copse where she was least likely to be interrupted she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial	103.67970563096097
bennet on having so fine a family of daughters said he had heard much of their beauty but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth and added that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage	275.3271829797306
indeed you must go for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not you are over scrupulous surely	67.16859890197142
the easy assurance of the young couple indeed was enough to provoke him	144.58417477435563
have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin yes and i had heard it before	223.88692252414526
bingley i always keep servants that can do their own work my daughters are brought up differently	547.6329315958268
she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him and turned away with a degree of ill humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr	59.43332746297963
colonel fitzwilliams manners were very much admired at the parsonage and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings	75.62186816934643
conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible i know it cannot be long he readily assured her of his secrecyagain expressed his sorrow for her distress wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope and leaving his compliments for her relations with only one serious parting look went away	411.05694686564556
let us hope for better things	91.67105907615274
miss darcy though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations readily obeyed	231.41433628625197
how grievous then was the thought that of a situation so desirable in every respect so replete with advantage so promising for happiness jane had been deprived by the folly and indecorum of her own family	328.9315301111356
she declared her resolution	63.69489253569731
how rich and how great you will be	95.41985343280884
i will speak to her about it myself directly	67.76479468794248
but my dear sister though the event has proved you right do not think me obstinate if i still assert that considering what her behaviour was my confidence was as natural as your suspicion	450.3435251175101
wickham his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited	286.6431217263116
well mamma said she when they were all returned to the breakfast room and what do you think of my husband	45.90621614525764
wickham in and near brighton with assurances of speedy payment for which i have pledged myself	405.8993213609552
the tumult of her mind was now painfully great	95.17314214040677
but she would not be secure	23.195237731323726
i do not like to boast of my own child but to be sure janeone does not often see any body better looking	162.85818884666924
good bye she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of being at home again in a day or two	271.55214268434673
younge was he knew intimately acquainted with wickham and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town	88.42979587153755
as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce	303.75728067858023
are the others coming out i do not know	48.787273031273685
i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun my beauty you had early withstood and as for my mannersmy behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not	277.84736314868525
while settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself who had once before called late in the evening and might now come to enquire particularly after her	205.82649056142088
you have insulted me in every possible method	76.62201107983373
do you certainly leave kent on saturday said she	191.97927516759532
take your choice but you must be satisfied with only one	100.36889284185199
darcys progress through his book as in reading her own and she was perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page	350.5391844971522
elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters reflecting on what she had heard and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it when sir william lucas himself appeared sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family	122.23473001165704
i knew said he that what i wrote must give you pain but it was necessary	72.50515924932976
every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter and in farther justification of mr	155.9044002047108
the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickhams worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him	148.18047606247782
i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being	313.2487349527996
darcy then was	24.863366251674808
you supposed more than really existed	388.8833927575578
to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds in the NUM per cents	161.21413664369823
in essentials i believe he is very much what he ever was while she spoke wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning	238.98702807147268
you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper	358.5199482335521
i have not forgot you see and i assure you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement bingley looked a little silly at this reflection and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business	157.67478102408006
unfortunately an only son for many years an only child i was spoilt by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own	435.66991715982914
to the civil enquiries which then poured in and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr	185.71190165510282
yours c this letter gave elizabeth some pain but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped by the sister at least	188.01140529518943
as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family the ceremony of leavetaking was performed when the ladies moved for the night and mrs	148.8034579259243
darcy may hug himself mr	48.44412785854074
they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother	287.4333383603713
four weeks passed away and jane saw nothing of him	131.77414430637904
darcy himself need not disdain and respectability which he will probably never reach when she thought of her mother indeed her confidence gave way a little but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with mr	428.4821857528406
but my dearest love tell me what dish mr	112.06647971708227
collins she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr	61.787699174538815
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr	98.88311570833777
she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable	148.9948518155502
since such were her feelings it only remained he thought to secure and expedite a marriage which in his very first conversation with wickham he easily learnt had never been his design	365.12708524132285
he did not leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business	95.87067763616241
she was sorry that mr	19.32628530608365
jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends and the attentions of their brother and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr	72.15418852572031

elizabeth immediately began playing again	118.89190882065097
when denny and wickham and pratt and two or three more of the men came in they did not know him in the least	122.30236081577557
he was most highly esteemed by mr	66.88011495416883
jane ran to her uncle and aunt and welcomed and thanked them both with alternate smiles and tears	206.67818820008168
your great men often are and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing as he might change his mind another day and warn me off his grounds elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character but said nothing	395.3790106971976
she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in silence on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree for in darcys breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against another	331.8377958027834
but if i go on i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem	134.83726960611924
but she is nothing to me now	23.681896854867883
such amiable qualities must speak for themselves	146.42269596107107
you both did as much as you could in planning the marriage	158.3816941004263
his attachment excited gratitude his general character respect but she could not approve him nor could she for a moment repent her refusal or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again	407.71108832283926
philips the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter	249.11518383726073

the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement	70.92282659617227
collins she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth but especially to the latter of whose connections she knew the least and who she observed to mrs	172.6761771838188
elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent it was for the sake of what had been rather than what was	112.09427285684549
the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl oh	566.5779793384482
darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy than the first vehemence of her disapprobation	143.32059281990038
she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors she wanted to compose her own and to make herself agreeable to all and in the latter object where she feared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour	142.8082403098856

hurst merely looked the gentleman but his friend mr	129.2310822728685
darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only i have not a doubt of mr	48.72284989296209

bingley i am sure	9.235274847987286
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she could not imagine	213.92782629213744
i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love said darcy	295.81812056255154
last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me because it would be imprudent and now because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is mercenary if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is i shall know what to think she is a very good kind of girl i believe	80.4954050638507
bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets her that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth but it will not do for us	191.8818045766894
his regiment is there for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire and of his being gone into the regulars	66.86971149915247
i never heard any harm of her and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world	40.65014970743698
but now it comes out my motive for cautioning you is as follows	309.7533382930079
collins was settled near her family it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire	66.16776367467254
they may wish many things besides his happiness they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money great connections and pride beyond a doubt they do wish him to chuse miss darcy replied jane but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing	462.18026474003
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added to her unwillingness to see mr	712.7475122343478
on the following monday mrs	57.135052525034595
what made you so shy of me when you first called and afterwards dined here	148.46764972884625
she longed to speak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence mrs	27.441874005923317
it is because he will not give himself the trouble i certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcy of conversing easily with those i have never seen before	247.4343704850858
wickham so very bad	45.65854683429438
but i will not repine	40.64328209838604
what i have to say relates to poor lydia	55.68476083994732
you excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general he can have no objection i am sure to oblige us for one half hour mr	156.87470592952167
gardiner did a question which she could not answer without confusion said scarcely any thing	95.76102722149682
louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again however little mr	162.05055878982714
jane who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth soon lagged behind while her sister panting for breath came up with him and eagerly cried out oh papa what news	234.07508979068115
it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection could do	190.95781764032046
collins had promised and as he had likewise foretold he took his seat at the bottom of the table by her ladyships desire and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater he carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity and every dish was commended first by him and then by sir william who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear	336.3410603602086
darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body went away	138.09609801685062
they will never be distressed for money	75.61937582500063
bennet as much as possible saying not much to elizabeth and nothing at all to the others	43.941162937378365
bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem	142.1575838997564
his surprise was great	48.5063849012194
it was a handsome modern building well situated on rising ground	215.1486288799715
collins and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyships praise into his own hands	204.00241678090015
remember that she is one of a large family that as to fortune it is a most eligible match and be ready to believe for every bodys sake that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin to oblige you i would try to believe almost any thing but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him i should only think worse of her understanding than i now do of her heart	196.80673674340255
and so extremely accomplished for her age	158.21795326447665
it was a painful but not an improbable conjecture	211.93731733963884
georgianas reception of them was very civil but attended with all that embarrassment which though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved	1123.064886887346
its completion depended on others	144.67171787226732
to jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused and whose merit she had undervalued but to her own more extensive information he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits and whom she regarded herself with an interest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just as what jane felt for bingley	206.4355271706236
nothing could console and nothing appease her nor did that day wear out her resentment	313.52214203157814
i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness	213.55390452118328
she was not rendered formidable by silence but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her selfimportance and brought mr	497.05235935960405
a place too with which so many of your acquaintance are connected	149.02304494718373
how thankful am i that we never let them know what has been said against him we must forget it ourselves	351.9292667424881
i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished nor i i am sure said miss bingley	93.62889562212642
i thank you again and again for not going to the lakes	19.184923142522834
he looked serious as usual and she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as she had seen him at pemberley	46.833948419867525
the two youngest of the family catherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions their minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothing better offered a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening and however bare of news the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some from their aunt	412.48836943976863
she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither but charlotte she soon found was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty	396.78111178631445
philips and was by her watchfulness most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin	681.0616359199754
on saturday morning elizabeth and mr	53.04421508250477
the apothecary came and having examined his patient said as might be supposed that she had caught a violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of it advised her to return to bed and promised her some draughts	212.89793392976776
much as i respect them i believe i thought only of you elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word	116.35360200862407
the hill crowned with wood from which they had descended receiving increased abruptness from the distance was a beautiful object	1211.5194598627404
he called it therefore his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself	152.41326620292745
hurst and miss bingley and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it	54.67277923574831
they agreed that mrs	37.63902296036127
after this day jane said no more of her indifference	81.58571360943401
my sister i am sure will not hear of her removal you may depend upon it madam said miss bingley with cold civility that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us mrs	115.95186427100217
i am going tomorrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him	236.08126328294927
yet in spite of all these temptations let me warn my cousin elizabeth and yourself of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentlemans proposals which of course you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of have you any idea lizzy who this gentleman is	384.0231330369497
i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myselffor i am fond of superior society but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas he paused in hopes of an answer but his companion was not disposed to make any and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing and called out to her my dear miss eliza why are not you dancing mr	213.83393047603482
darcy was condemned as the worst of men	129.96013761600827

it was all conjecture what is it you mean it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known because if it were to get round to the ladys family it would be an unpleasant thing you may depend upon my not mentioning it and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley	157.30450267259224
my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness and in a cause of such moment as this i shall certainly not depart from it	301.8249566345903

here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse	191.16935041842495
he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant	102.27328253051968
and pray may i ask but checking himself he added in a gayer tone is it in address that he improves	370.1103267057955
philips began to express her concern thereupon he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance that he considered the money as a mere trifle and begged she would not make herself uneasy	384.6575350386428
but still he would be her husband without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony marriage had always been her object it was the only honourable provision for welleducated young women of small fortune and however uncertain of giving happiness must be their pleasantest preservative from want	508.32295644053875
and to be kept back on such a motive i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind upon my word said her ladyship you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person pray what is your age with three younger sisters grown up replied elizabeth smiling your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence	335.76767350025017
bennet who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him continued her triumph	223.11715784543355
he was directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together with either of which motives his joining them would interfere	376.61548265203913
oh sister	37.35570593302742
well well said he do not make yourself unhappy	58.02780282886083
bennet yes or i will never see her again an unhappy alternative is before you elizabeth	291.69071246313734
a few days after this visit mr	44.64092491878822
maria thought speaking out of the question and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire	182.30465719373407
gardiner could do	13.650001684057363
i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town every body was surprised and darcy after looking at her for a moment turned silently away	66.9938997642762
she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter and without knowing or considering what their income might be rejected many as deficient in size and importance	432.7109317950429
in this danger kitty is also comprehended	361.36746541856473
his appearance was greatly in his favour he had all the best part of beauty a fine countenance a good figure and very pleasing address	266.3062765028933
its effect was most extraordinary for on first hearing it mrs	186.78180298252613
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends and she could do nothing but think and think with wonder of mr	100.5790375830949
he danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner	184.42807341256486
i can comprehend your going on charmingly when you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first place i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation	484.52791326607274
after tea mr	25.961863169326328
not a syllable was uttered by either and elizabeth was on the point of going away again when bingley who as well as the other had sat down suddenly rose and whispering a few words to her sister ran out of the room	84.56609660694991
sir william did not say much	22.842207635666785
when the card tables were placed he had an opportunity of obliging her in return by sitting down to whist	160.45427990364794
gardiner though seldom able to indulge the taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man about them that he advanced but little	166.19668204643656
this unfortunate affair will i fear prevent my sisters having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley today oh yes	294.0898383978942
i am glad he is gone	12.546953380378138
miss bennets astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings	726.4601518616734
she could not win him however to any conversation he merely answered her question and read on	183.15391712284827
can it be possible that he will marry her wickham is not so undeserving then as we have thought him said her sister	134.9318516990988
she is so fond of mrs	28.930174165680146
darcy just deigned to return	123.75195142850353
let us sit down	31.785200655256755
the children two girls of six and eight years old and two younger boys were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane who was the general favourite and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every wayteaching them playing with them and loving them	504.330445573072
during dinner mr	40.50470316194761
it was only said lately george wickham esq	99.29072155244585
bennet who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished was excessively disappointed	172.61735605232283
bennets emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort for it gratified him he said to discover that charlotte lucas whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible was as foolish as his wife and more foolish than his daughter	235.47586630922999
but there were two or three much uglier in the shop and when i have bought some prettiercoloured satin to trim it with fresh i think it will be very tolerable	156.11927874392538
the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasions justifying her coming so far alone	242.03842492473314
darcy is particularly fond of that i may have it tomorrow this was a sad omen of what her mothers behaviour to the gentleman himself might be and elizabeth found that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection and secure of her relations consent there was still something to be wished for	208.0326044898487
elizabeth to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this heard it in silent indignation	140.88626214416874
darcy is all politeness said elizabeth smiling	125.20676225481881
i should have considered it as part of my duty and the exertion would soon have been nothing	53.139829644444845
one enjoyment was certainthat of suitableness as companions a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniencescheerfulness to enhance every pleasureand affection and intelligence which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad	1053.5244721659926
i came to you without a doubt of my reception	35.32110283088203
he has given in all his debts i hope at least he has not deceived us	91.40978722173546
and so did mrs	23.588605425919745
her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered	80.54908420747563
but vanity not love has been my folly pleased with the preference of one and offended by the neglect of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance i have courted prepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either were concerned	375.87069834461016
you used us abominably ill answered mrs	344.7565527055813
i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that implies when i wrote that letter replied darcy i believed myself perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so	477.987401256656
implacable resentment is a shade in a character	215.90742584225697
i perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been	144.94965354065178
but it was her business to be satisfiedand certainly her temper to be happy and all was soon right again	157.2791563425227
and when we do return it shall not be like other travellers without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing	115.12934067553826
your alliance will be a disgrace your name will never even be mentioned by any of us these are heavy misfortunes replied elizabeth	335.3999555029482
you are to understand miss bennet that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose nor will i be dissuaded from it	200.69168847142848
the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed	125.41516667629548
let me do it without farther loss of time	61.94929486540682
but in matters of greater weight i may suffer from the want of money	151.86373439092725
darcy on the contrary had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none received either attention or pleasure	334.6089410831495
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due my object then replied darcy was to shew you by every civility in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to	300.6477063593696
they had all been very illused since she last saw her sister	73.28362515548868
you need not send them word at longbourn of my going if you do not like it for it will make the surprise the greater when i write to them and sign my name lydia wickham	164.16076754992525
philips was an amiable intelligent elegant woman and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces	178.8677281828856
but what does he say of the living he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard them from mr	102.50087235455867
i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off and then i should have gone quite distracted	188.51382897192434
wickham has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character	182.57423475750306
darcy seemed much pleased with the attention	39.89837742734715
smiles decked the face of mrs	65.96948824882837
bingleys being imposed on than that mr	72.94399033961913
darcy you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner you cannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before you and taking her hand he would have given it to mr	112.337751065597
in her own past behaviour there was a constant source of vexation and regret and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin	132.16786314024222
colonel forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body	152.67739880655753
i shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on	62.56676674939871

jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from caroline	226.2725623503201
they battled it together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved	139.43263419159513
with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr	55.457122956648014
my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room	65.61617608680653
miss darcys praise occupied the chief of it	104.65877226428171
accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me	210.15485131497675
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations	137.78182242204394
what an excellent father you have girls said she when the door was shut	60.207221187080435
gardiner had seen pemberley and known the late mr	36.511661359182675
let me never see either one or the other again yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former lover	301.9049836187742
elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingleys regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it	200.42464661089912
there is nothing else to be done	12.158556864118532
darcy speaking to her ayebecause she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he could not help answering herbut she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to miss bingley told me said jane that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance	295.7655329440132
it is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country	52.307317638953975
elizabeth though she did not credit above half of what was said believed enough to make her former assurance of her sisters ruin still more certain and even jane who believed still less of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now come when if they had gone to scotland which she had never before entirely despaired of they must in all probability have gained some news of them	296.79770354100526
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching and a fortnight only was wanting of it when a letter arrived from mrs	337.4862453289218
but lizzy you have been very sly very reserved with me	124.41925576354348
my visit was not long as caroline and mrs	61.2288149040503
it is such a spur to ones genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind	156.63806503526177
it is just as he chooses	18.639785855899504
you are so strange	36.181184117057064
they were not the only objects of mr	34.8247815742092
there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself	182.1973839195874
they soon outstripped the others and when they had reached the carriage mr	46.391012449040936
it must be his own doing he is his own master	68.78961766858255
darcy than they had before any idea of it was evident that he was very much in love with her	24.400031447035893
presuming however that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of society a perfect willingness to accept it she ventured to engage for her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on	303.3374240635937
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton a most convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliners shop just over the way	237.66010372715726
the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himselffrom whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousins affairs and whose character she had no reason to question	219.1841525517812
from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them	191.22747491171296
an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched and already had mrs	112.09426225200285
her mothers ungraciousness made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeths mind and she would at times have given any thing to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family	175.65654628301712
see paragraph NUM c below	33.84218458061419
her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressingroom to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself	218.467073672473
i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object	32.16586580169146
we will go round the park every day	23.811172405543754
i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it	162.45051979863118
it was an evening of no common delight to them all the satisfaction of miss bennets mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face as made her look handsomer than ever	130.3384197801942
in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls without any selfreproach	221.28513956464977
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs	152.33498772493812
our importance our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydias character	370.79789166876964
in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be observed in them for ever yes indeed cried mrs	214.67998791658792
four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunts arrival	209.76628689266394
after lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation of thinking that mr	90.39059693144816
this is an evening of wonders indeed	123.95664510388097
darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friends inclination or why upon his own judgment alone he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy but she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him	197.85458882674484
they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others for who as lady catherine herself condescendingly says will connect themselves with such a family	205.68506089559193
but it is of small importance i might as well enquire replied she why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character	375.1568700540378
as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner	72.71789089043806
does he know his real character i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did	90.76523919855374
it was the last of the regiments stay in meryton and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace	51.42615469373571
bingley of course returned with him to dinner and in the evening mrs	49.113943197282026
i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not mrs	69.24253813624398
darcy she left elizabeth to walk by herself	67.38040827587464
they were ignorant idle and vain	107.384562249558
but that gentleman looking at darcy seemed to think the country was nothing at all indeed mama you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for her mother	123.07726498767423
by the author of sense and sensibility vol	4.812746331316875
you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have tortured methough it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression	254.4839770062199
bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future	100.37059079879515
darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the doorbell and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room	355.9247488802606
there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings she was a little revived however by his bringing back his coffee cup himself and she seized the opportunity of saying is your sister at pemberley still yes she will remain there till christmas and quite alone	399.72891273622815
you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general	54.07655439443493
will you do me the honour of reading that letter and then with a slight bow turned again into the plantation and was soon out of sight	131.7079352760889
into one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance	196.1283877949806
when is your turn to come	13.606820505081732
as for wickham and lydia their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters	104.8313074165282
there is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping i dare say no nothing at all a great deal of good management depend upon it	94.86637331978396
they had frequently been staying with her in town	68.22274580596249
he sat down for a few moments and then getting up walked about the room	69.05591344450177
in short i will do my best perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often	115.59929607680033
and it is such a good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now now kitty you may cough as much as you chuse said mr	88.02552702179797
my dear madam he replied this invitation is particularly gratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible they were all astonished and mr	102.4253109638704
jane i take your place now and you must go lower because i am a married woman it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first	241.0992134780835
gardiner the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share	221.0149756061685
lizzy said he what are you doing	51.96588906765329
his behaviour to myself has been scandalous but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened with all her heart but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry	329.8384487402877
my dear lydia she cried when shall we meet again oh lord	49.476253110876314
our plain manner of living our small rooms and few domestics and the little we see of the world must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness	217.4422181161255
wickham were returned and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball	90.34889537584158
he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs	66.54646877265132
every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months but he never distinguished her by any particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during the whole of the journey	656.1735522099013
hurst had a house	23.33950342982448
that is the place to get husbands	36.3523402474101
i have been a disappointed man and my spirits will not bear solitude	192.18389415917468
he has heartily forgiven me now elizabeth longed to observe that mr	81.1648757065541
this preservative she had now obtained and at the age of twentyseven without having ever been handsome she felt all the good luck of it	196.2598426967229
she was overpowered by shame and vexation	37.402024074608384
darcys having both spent three weeks at rosings and asked him if he were acquainted with the former	197.60540954060815
bennet you are wanted immediately we are all in an uproar	92.17661921811107
the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane and in short as the time drew near she would have been very sorry for any delay	218.32005006579584
are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do oh yes	42.24956939470983
from their infancy they have been intended for each other	121.24498432574782
there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed i am very sensible madam of the hardship to my fair cousins and could say much on the subject but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate	238.5032275847693
they entered it in one of its lowest points and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent	500.94500735703787
he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter of which it seems he has been told by some of the goodnatured gossiping lucases	406.4714728810459
wickhams charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could bring no proof of its injustice	961.6288577066125
i know you will contrive it all but mr	45.503554029478195
my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them	44.709679010023635
elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked towards his friend	165.4966016007743
when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen they returned down stairs and taking leave of the housekeeper were consigned over to the gardener who met them at the hall door	289.0373334438057
but the case is this	25.989932042614594
yours c as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind	116.5067152081372
it was moreover such a promising thing for her younger daughters as janes marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked	208.92777735145512
pray do not talk of that odious man	81.93436956702729
bennet treated the matter differently	188.25310025341636
i quite detest the man chapter iv	141.40314374120672
and one of my own daughters	22.04098128052655
bennet with more perseverance than politeness protested he must be entirely mistaken and lydia always unguarded and often uncivil boisterously exclaimed good lord	1022.3735345421019
elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister for while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on any one else but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur	238.68124397485428
bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he could to the great consolation of his sister who considered it as the only security for her husbands not being killed in a duel	114.50259731135068
his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it	115.24239992713277
i am going to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows you are a very strange creature by way of a friend always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body if my vanity had taken a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers on miss lucass persevering however she added very well if it must be so it must and gravely glancing at mr	190.37235822552478
the little gardiners attracted by the sight of a chaise were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock and when the carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety of capers and frisks was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome	286.86438154215114
darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning	107.7613486465284
jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs	374.08591934951187
it cannot be concealed from any one	29.053933152633906
bingleys being there and as to the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his	109.31821153334455
the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every mornings impatience	508.13846871380093
but i have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr	226.9176083976897
reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his fathers life time	134.5538856710027
she had only to say in reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge	70.87815591262775
generous good man i am afraid he has distressed himself	110.23052836421499
lydiathe humiliation the misery she was bringing on them all soon swallowed up every private care and covering her face with her handkerchief elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else and after a pause of several minutes was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion who in a manner which though it spoke compassion spoke likewise restraint said i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay but real though unavailing concern	394.712849020004
collins she added that lizzy shall be brought to reason	146.44135031132512
her figure was elegant and she walked wellbut darcy at whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious	176.94509825100363
why does she not come in oh	126.89301633401054
her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved	472.5670732937231
limited right of replacement or refund if you discover a defect in this electronic work within NUM days of receiving it you can receive a refund of the money if any you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from	157.8621399302905
but now it was all too natural	88.2205106132875
stupid men are the only ones worth knowing after all take care lizzy that speech savours strongly of disappointment before they were separated by the conclusion of the play she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer	468.0024660232031
bennet arrived he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure	86.84909509040389
she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger and wondered it had escaped her before	123.47993951520446
her mind was less difficult to develope	71.64574066289217
my dear mr	4.7073906382066415
this was his plan of amendsof atonementfor inheriting their fathers estate and he thought it an excellent one full of eligibility and suitableness and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part	320.68965406390635
however i did not hear above one word in ten for i was thinking you may suppose of my dear wickham	160.26894025455238
but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i could would mr	153.8236797539324
but who was your mother	30.63220663472755
she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend	141.34339839887
she wrote also with great pleasure of her brothers being an inmate of mr	54.76779708978737
it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give but they were now necessary and she assured him with some confusion of her attachment to mr	131.82296327093297
tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet with great pleasure	75.34648561771286
but papa is so disagreeable a little seabathing would set me up for ever and my aunt philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good added kitty	182.553868385443
no principle of either would be violated by my marriage with mr	180.56193549439885
to the rest of the family they paid little attention avoiding mrs	109.21329528038284
well much good may it do them	170.26652337418662
darcy with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her	85.09825997262696
charlottes first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home how she would like lady catherine and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be though when the letters were read elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen	230.94079048075028
lady catherine said she you have given me a treasure are any of your younger sisters out miss bennet yes maam all all what all five out at once	225.62673232408562
there was also a postscript to this effect	53.81858717002301
not handsome enough to dance with	23.071562208934616
lydias voice was heard in the vestibule the door was thrown open and she ran into the room	45.86215785452123
her astonishment at his comingat his coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire	220.88267774233861
she saw with the creative eye of fancy the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers	333.0837942195639
your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not goand at another word might stay a month you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that mr	443.73254105245314
he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming said her uncle	175.54174540912013
she listened most attentively to all that passed between them and gloried in every expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence his taste or his good manners	368.12902496103527
unless a copyright notice is included	782.4127867246127
if he had another motive i am sure it would never disgrace him	44.29134968426061
there can be no love in all this	28.610218389729063
it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her	61.237064911763866
the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of ranksuch affability and condescension as he had himself experienced from lady catherine	173.58611800553356
clements because wickhams lodgings were in that parish	568.807547829899
they are going to be encamped near brighton and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer	143.2322620668112
what will be his surprise thought she when he knows who they are	164.45020893717984
teazing teazing man	523.0281459672107
bingleys will always be welcome here to be sure but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern	243.47866344411182
all field sports were over	180.76206114128072
for my own part she rejoined i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her	85.98640118000428
jane was so admired nothing could be like it	104.49898118859595

when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas and was in conversation with her when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr	122.12712158720008
once or twice she could discern a faint blush but in general charlotte wisely did not hear	418.3039215675005
i have by no means done	28.444704429662746
they were therefore to go elizabeth was pleased though when she asked herself the reason she had very little to say in reply	90.21678350109498
i am truly glad dearest lizzy that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes but now as the first shock is over shall i own that i long for your return	294.0756613925968

when the teathings were removed and the card tables placed the ladies all rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mothers rapacity for whist players and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party	268.65794998208384
reynoldss respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master	184.92408024319516
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command	129.8759930642678
and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater beauty	54.4922538875296
it is a great comfort to have you so rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will think of us	27.544308043843706
and if i am that choice why may not i accept him because honour decorum prudence nay interest forbid it	1359.470442567478
that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance oh	76.98127910687322
her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies	336.03782055023345

end of the second volume	22.028095182551453
my father and mother believe the worst but i cannot think so ill of him	29.803384150290036
if they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us if he were so they could not succeed	126.7788789428154
she was very wrong in singling me out as she did i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side	149.80350553712125
of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity	282.8524367069729
it appeared to her merely the suggestion of carolines interested wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes however openly or artfully spoken could influence a young man so totally independent of every one	396.37525330749463

the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow	156.7662424134035
all were struck with the strangers air all wondered who he could be and kitty and lydia determined if possible to find out led the way across the street under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot	565.4743849215532

wickham who had returned with him the day before from town and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps	137.59895671529304
human nature is so prone to fall into it	174.46005884978067
on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now	399.2835132968937

at length there was nothing more to be said the ladies drove on and the others returned into the house	74.20619857954318
wickham and give him an invitation also if the family from longbourn would come in the evening	127.20420867850342
it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before but that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed so doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea	165.78971331250057
this information however startled mrs	222.68472481829005
is her husband is the son of his late fathers steward to be his brother	180.9899227423009

my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday after my father went away and was so good as to stay till thursday with me	159.46989963003065
at length in a voice of forced calmness he said and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting	145.3402463779821
my mind was more agreeably engaged	179.17782654715842
but it is returned she for mrs	43.265482689249986
bingleys she could not make a very favourable answer	20.24141532495617
she had very little notice from any but him	117.72573402961264
the rest of the evening passed with the appearance on his side of usual cheerfulness but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth and they parted at last with mutual civility and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again	387.13853011365893
lady catherine listened to half a song and then talked as before to her other nephew till the latter walked away from her and moving with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performers countenance	558.2207607503217

bingley when questioned by jane had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair that proud and repulsive as were his manners she had never in the whole course of their acquaintance an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjustany thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits	209.50922628409612

at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity	176.48594668154874
but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs	86.48046703179291
my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how imprudent a match it must be	72.11037185931448
he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former	175.97134885305047
did you see it bingley replied that he did and made his congratulations	83.69644352533494
their lodgings were not long a secret and at length they began to know the officers themselves	110.16787169978805
she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct	551.2715787716008

how could you begin said she	36.63448577955565
but however that shant prevent my asking him to dine here i am determined	186.06838902406153
bennet i am quite delighted with him	10.242065105024922
he had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it	106.47530328096305
it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us	107.85165992019006
jane was not deceived but she was affected and though feeling no reliance on her could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved	378.98918665900186
at our time of life it is not so pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintance every day but for your sakes we would do any thing	145.95424237786824
there is no danger of wickhams marrying mary king	113.49997363445105
their father then went to the library to write and the girls walked into the breakfastroom	61.583258056309695
yes said elizabeth drily mr	145.5970802213545
my father was not only fond of this young mans society whose manners were always engaging he had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be his profession intended to provide for him in it	154.19122205239907
i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time	97.14904006524374
she put down the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartialitydeliberated on the probability of each statementbut with little success	273.6787844922786
bennet was quite disconcerted	57.37864179420408
in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage	78.34627223658869
i will read you the passage which particularly hurts me	161.90756140670337
bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydias interruption and promised that it should not occur again if he would resume his book but mr	348.43639653722505
bingley urged mr	62.98141116734412
collins for having spoken so sensibly and observed in a halfwhisper to lady lucas that he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man	99.5379470490657
amongst the most violent against him was mrs	165.88134044863682
no i am sure we never read the same or not with the same feelings i am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be no want of subject we may compare our different opinions noi cannot talk of books in a ballroom my head is always full of something else the present always occupies you in such scenesdoes it said he with a look of doubt	200.13986639684208

joness being sent for immediately while his sisters convinced that no country advice could be of any service recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians	495.0139646367779
collins joining in observed yes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church and i need not say you will be delighted with her	83.65065290334455
gardiner who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible	124.83582751751311
and then you know when once they get together there is no end of it	132.98944996124303
it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that his affection might be reanimated and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of janes attractions	154.2443502915728
pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel fitzwilliam	31.311434942135136
it is too long ago	14.180347028806235
darcy who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish and who probably never looked at you in his life	183.59295154454034
she was disappointed and angry with herself for being so	89.79579062546563
could he or the lucases have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related	361.8415142160597
they shook hands with great cordiality and then till her sister came down she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness and of janes perfections and in spite of his being a lover elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded because they had for basis the excellent understanding and superexcellent disposition of jane and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself	316.6512565841617
collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs	98.59377206060435
there is a lady it seems a mrs	40.68897176396354
collins was punctual to his time and was received with great politeness by the whole family	34.51349849830653
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth and elizabeth agitated and confused rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so for besides the immediate embarrassment there were other evils before her	364.42565100122033
all that is required of you is to assure to your daughter by settlement her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister and moreover to enter into an engagement of allowing her during your life one hundred pounds per annum	324.2699174375996
the good news quickly spread through the house and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood	200.10049209257073
that she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head	111.17882570754757
the favour of your company has been much felt i assure you	85.4939232424096
the conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable but since then we have both i hope improved in civility i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself	269.3270201324776
and as i come back i can call on lady lucas and mrs	58.905956148904295
they attacked him in various ways with barefaced questions ingenious suppositions and distant surmises but he eluded the skill of them all and they were at last obliged to accept the secondhand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas	309.7199567244775
kitty was the only one who shed tears but she did weep from vexation and envy	236.9051423113498
i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part except the shops and public places	372.5365053089087
collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be imaginary	235.5699729750726
how strange this is	36.994874393274756
miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth	409.61926507285835
i know my dear uncle and aunt so well that i am not afraid of requesting it though i have still something more to ask of the former	43.56616736843302
miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility mr	117.87487242908917
he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stoodthe sort of preference which was often given me i had not thought mr	164.61986855031356
never since reading janes second letter had she entertained a hope of wickhams meaning to marry her	379.19356245477667
he observed to her at a moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had something of real regret that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her and before she could reply he added it is above eight months	104.64177261220301
i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one but i always speak what i think i know you do and it is that which makes the wonder	147.485160933792
darcy walked off and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him	344.0926290330878
not these two or three years perhaps write to me very often my dear as often as i can	95.52724330380315
wickham immediately to elizabeths mind and from the observation of the day altogether she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented	130.43544499847596
bingley did not do justice to his own disposition	20.419128540253748
darcy he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam	68.87650769876218
i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that dining out said mrs	114.56933573963057
to the little town of lambton the scene of mrs	95.12872372059108
accordingly when she retired at night she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place what was the name of its proprietor and with no little alarm whether the family were down for the summer	341.98360800902105
but the fact is that we are very different sort of men and that he hates me this is quite shocking he deserves to be publicly disgraced some time or other he will bebut it shall not be by me	98.73921970993021
the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of	179.62355604802275
i do not trust my own partiality	43.96888420878068
bennet and the children	21.950430569282865
i cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns as i often see done my fingers said elizabeth do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many womens do	468.51714047732503
can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand oh yes that that is the worst of all	124.88212967973072
as soon as they entered the copse lady catherine began in the following manner you can be at no loss miss bennet to understand the reason of my journey hither	95.23248004017964
bennetshe would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not to believe it and could not help saying so	94.46545692866424
has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves	112.44233242282777
tell him what a dreadful state i am in that i am frightened out of my wits and have such tremblings such flutterings all over me such spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day	395.9797723652306
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world though only a few weeks before when lydia had first run away they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune	246.05343747802502
oh lord	10.546400633918699
it would vex me indeed to see you again the dupe of miss bingleys pretended regard would you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last november he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again he made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of his modesty this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence and the little value he put on his own good qualities	220.27623493122184
there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer and i have enquired of every body too who is likely to know i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more oh well	103.58481251977916
her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas forbore to invite him to sit by herself	208.00607307972493
she was roused from her seat and her reflections by some ones approach and before she could strike into another path she was overtaken by wickham	269.16974642704685
jane was distressed	14.669713229852704
having been frequently in company with him since her return agitation was pretty well over the agitations of former partiality entirely so	529.4245808045661

the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion	85.50238525174746

what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosings park when he put his letter into her hand	273.35664905842305
i could not bear to have her ten miles from me and as for purvis lodge the attics are dreadful her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained	240.02961885034057
gardiner with occasional help from elizabeth the conversation was carried on	229.14863076670838

you have delighted us long enough	69.27324914819962
as no objection was made to the young peoples engagement with their aunt and all mr	197.85343306810086
but she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so illjudged a direction of talents talents which rightly used might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife	633.2286568139625

they have a sharp shrewish look which i do not like at all and in her air altogether there is a selfsufficiency without fashion which is intolerable persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth this was not the best method of recommending herself but angry people are not always wise and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled she had all the success she expected	306.53488261416146
